Review: A solid start to the marathon. Lots of AI manips, a few cases of physics being weird, intermixed with some fun randomness and a crowd-participation gimmick. Ends with an adorkable musical number, if that's what you're into.

Review: Another new game. The speedrun here is a lot more about routing a certain number of side objectives, which leads to some interesting routing, and there's a lot more movement tech than I expected. And Mr_Shasta brings plenty of charisma to the party. The showcase afterward isn't that impressive but might be cool for players who never knew those secrets were there.

Review: This series is just not a good speed game, and I'm honestly kind of baffled we've seen the whole trilogy now. I don't recall a single piece of speed tech being explained - there was barely even any gameplay explanation, it was almost entirely a story explainer. Given what these games are, I'm not sure that's the wrong call, but "listening to someone rush through an undramatic recitation of the events of their favorite story" is something most people consider torturous, not enjoyable.

Review: I'm just not sure what the point of this run was supposed to be. The execution didn't impress me. The routing was uninteresting. What tech there was, wasn't that cool. There was an absolute wall of jargon, but not much display of depth of knowledge. Perhaps I'm just not in the target audience - I hated the only Monster Hunter game I played - but I was just not entertained in any way.

Review: The unenlightened masses might frown on all the memes and the butt jokes, but anyone who's played the game knows that's just the way it is. The fans of the game will appreciate how Meka cuts through levels with some major OOB, and blasts through the bosses with some careful phase-skipping strats and maxed-out NG+ weapons that just will not let up. I think we can both agree, though, that this was a pretty fun run, and in the end, the only thing I know for real is that I had fun watching this, and hopefully you will too.

Review: It's a long, vanilla Pokemon run, so you probably know what to expect. The skill on display here is encyclopedeic knowledge of the game and some quick maths. But even with the detail this route gets into, that's not enough to fill nearly four hours, so a lot of the fun has to come from shenanigans among the runner, couch, host, and crowd. This wasn't quite the riot that the earlier randomizer run was... but it was still pretty good.

Review: In this game, RBO is basically just a flex - they could easily warp straight to the final level, as is done in any%, but instead they repeatedly use the tricks to fight every boss in an impossible order. Commentary is necessarily a bit dry, but it's a pretty technical run, no way around it, and there's a lot of frame-perfect tricks getting hit.

Review: When things happen in this TAS, they happen fast. It's bursts of frame-level execution, sprinkled among quite a bit of waiting for dialogue and triggers to finish. Getting some live human-speedrunner reactions was neat, but technical commentary was limited by the sheer timescale difference between machine and humans.

Review: An incredibly technical run, with lots of incredibly technical commentary, but Linkus makes it pretty easy to grok. And even if you don't, the run is just so far from intended gameplay that it's amazing just to watch.

Review: It's all the technical complexity and absurdity of an ACE TAS, except done by humans. It's not easy to explain without a decent grasp of computer science, but it's worth ten minutes just for the spectacle.

Review: This might be the newest Metroid game, but the movement in this is so good that it's already one of the best speedruns. No Major Glitches does let you see most of the game, but far faster than you ever would casually.

Review: The very last in-person run we saw, before The Pandemic hit, was Oatsngoats's run of Super Metroid Impossible. So it's fitting that the return of on-site marathons sees the return of extremely-hard Super Metroid hacks - and this one is downright sadistic. Nothing two and a half hours of Serious Gaming can't solve.

Review: It's a neat trick, but the skill was all in the finding and the routing, not in the execution, nor is it all that impressive on its own. This definitely suffers from the delay - as a follow-on to the Any% BD/SP run, it would have been fine, but without that it's just twenty minutes of menuing and walking in a black screen.
