Review: A solid start to the marathon. Lots of AI manips, a few cases of physics being weird, intermixed with some fun randomness and a crowd-participation gimmick. Ends with an adorkable musical number, if that's what you're into.

Review: Another new game. The speedrun here is a lot more about routing a certain number of side objectives, which leads to some interesting routing, and there's a lot more movement tech than I expected. And Mr_Shasta brings plenty of charisma to the party. The showcase afterward isn't that impressive but might be cool for players who never knew those secrets were there.

Review: This series is just not a good speed game, and I'm honestly kind of baffled we've seen the whole trilogy now. I don't recall a single piece of speed tech being explained - there was barely even any gameplay explanation, it was almost entirely a story explainer. Given what these games are, I'm not sure that's the wrong call, but "listening to someone rush through an undramatic recitation of the events of their favorite story" is something most people consider torturous, not enjoyable.

Review: Quake engine movement is already busted. Adding Force powers to that, only pushes it over the top again. It's a full-throttle run full of skips and jokes, that just never lets up.

Review: A run combining the OoB shenanigans and polished arena clears of older Halo runs, with the prop-launching shenanigans and massive underleveling of a BotW run. Plus some frantic improvisation when things don't quite work as expected, like in most runs this new.

Review: Three hours of watching a group of top-tier Pokemon runners battle the RNG, chat, and each other? Yes please. As a randomizer, the skill comes mostly from an encyclopedeic knowledge of the game, which we definitely had. And as a Pokemon game, it was heavy on banter and memes.
