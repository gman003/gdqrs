Review: A solid start to the marathon. Lots of AI manips, a few cases of physics being weird, intermixed with some fun randomness and a crowd-participation gimmick. Ends with an adorkable musical number, if that's what you're into.

Review: Another new game. The speedrun here is a lot more about routing a certain number of side objectives, which leads to some interesting routing, and there's a lot more movement tech than I expected. And Mr_Shasta brings plenty of charisma to the party. The showcase afterward isn't that impressive but might be cool for players who never knew those secrets were there.

Review: The runner and couch made a crucial mistake here: they never really explained the basic gameplay. Or any of the speed tech beyond "trying to get certain items that let you skip over entire levels". If there is any deeper skill needed to master this run, it was not obvious just from watching. Perhaps, for die-hard Bubble Bobble fans, this was an amazing run, but for outsiders? Easily skippable.

Review: NiGHTS is a very weird game, which I think needed more basic explanation than we actually got. It's hard to appreciate speedrun tricks when you don't even know what normal gameplay looks like. This will probably be fun for anyone who actually played it, but it kind of fell flat for me as an outside.

Review: This series is just not a good speed game, and I'm honestly kind of baffled we've seen the whole trilogy now. I don't recall a single piece of speed tech being explained - there was barely even any gameplay explanation, it was almost entirely a story explainer. Given what these games are, I'm not sure that's the wrong call, but "listening to someone rush through an undramatic recitation of the events of their favorite story" is something most people consider torturous, not enjoyable.

Review: This is just not a great speed game. Looks like a great game, just not a good speedrun. There's very little tech, but what tech there is, trivializes all the battles. Even with some built-in skips, the run feels like it's half cutscenes, if not more. The couch made a good effort to be interesting, but by avoiding spoilers, they were left with very little to talk about, the back half was basically a nonstop donation read.

Review: A neat new Castlevania-like - sort of a blend of the original flavor with the metroidvanias. And a shockingly good speedrun, a current-year game has no business having a run this complex and this polished. It's only one real glitch, but it's used in so many different ways, in different places, and even the normal gameplay shown was quite clean.

Review: Just a very lethargic run. The IGT was barely half the RTA time - it might not have story cutscenes, but there were incessant panning shots of doors opening or bridges rising, that all dragged on far too long. The runner stayed mostly silent - understandable, given the language barrier - but that slack was resolutely *not* picked up by the couch. It seemed like a return to SGDQ2020, where lag kept the couch commentary well behind the actual action. Nor did we get much in the way of tech explanation. It wasn't an awful run to watch, but it certainly wasn't great.

Review: An unexpectedly fun run of an unexpectedly turn-based JRPG. Froob's legendary charisma remains on full display, this time backed up by some skillful menuing and near-infinite game knowledge, alternating seamlessly between lore explainers and combat primers. If you think four hours is just too long for a speedrun, this might not be for you, but if you enjoy long JRPG runs, this is among the best.

Review: Three hours of high-octane platforming, using one of the most fluid and powerful movement systems in the genre, executing one of the tightest routes in speedrunning? Yes please. Most runs of this length are full of downtime - this one, you get two seconds for the Moon Get jingle, and then it's back to jumping in ways never thought possible. Combine it with an excellent couch, and a hype live crowd... yeah, GDQ is back, baby.

Review: This was unfortunately pretty hard to follow - the tracker was just two basic counts, and there was just so much going on, at such high a level, that you could have had in-depth continuous commentary on each individual runner. Trying to keep up with all four is pretty much impossible, unless you're a die-hard FF6 fanatic. It still entertains on a simple "how can they be this good?" level, but you don't get too much sense of *how*.

But no, Elise was in full focus mode, barely said anything, and her couch bombarded us with lore dump after lore dump, for a game that, as best I can tell, has pretty thin lore. The speed tech might have been interesting, but it was perhaps too fast to commentate properly.

Review: This was an exceptional run, in a literal way: a few unfortunate deaths led to a game-over, and with no save, that meant a restart, 45 minutes into the run. To keep things going, it was turned into a "finish as much as possible before the estimate", but retreading the early levels really sapped the commentary until it reached new sections of the game. But even with those mistakes, SB's execution was top-notch, and once the couch got back into the swing of things, they did well. But there's no denying that it did hurt the run.

It's different from previous BL2 runs - singleplayer and with preset weapons on NG+, making it a run of rocket-jumping and one-shotting bosses, in between a fair bit of OoB and dialogue skips. Somehow, even after an hour, there was still stuff to explain. There were a few wave fights that dragged the tempo down, but even those simply gave the couch time to catch up on some of the smaller details we may have missed.

Review: A run that was on the verge of being much better. The runner had plenty of energy, but it came off more as "nervous and overcaffeinated" than "enthusiastic". The dev could have offered great details and anecdotes, but somehow seemed the most bored with his own game, barely able to explain the general concept. It took maybe half an hour for them to find any sort of groove, and even then it had some persistent audio-mix issues. On top of that, the game is a very traditional PS1-era RE clone, with whatever new mechanics were added barely playing any role in the speedrun. If you really like RE Trilogy gameplay, this might be worth a watch, but otherwise... eh.

Review: It's a long, vanilla Pokemon run, so you probably know what to expect. The skill on display here is encyclopedeic knowledge of the game and some quick maths. But even with the detail this route gets into, that's not enough to fill nearly four hours, so a lot of the fun has to come from shenanigans among the runner, couch, host, and crowd. This wasn't quite the riot that the earlier randomizer run was... but it was still pretty good.

Review: In this game, RBO is basically just a flex - they could easily warp straight to the final level, as is done in any%, but instead they repeatedly use the tricks to fight every boss in an impossible order. Commentary is necessarily a bit dry, but it's a pretty technical run, no way around it, and there's a lot of frame-perfect tricks getting hit.

Review: When things happen in this TAS, they happen fast. It's bursts of frame-level execution, sprinkled among quite a bit of waiting for dialogue and triggers to finish. Getting some live human-speedrunner reactions was neat, but technical commentary was limited by the sheer timescale difference between machine and humans.

Review: This is another thing that was hard to do in the pandemic era - relay races. Seeing top kaizo runners play through levels they've never seen does dull the skill ceiling a bit, but the race format, and seeing how quickly they perfect each segment, more than makes up for it. Once again, the only really disappointing thing was the specific format - it didn't feel like the "winners" really won, but since it's all for show anyways, I don't mind too much.

Review: A run that far exceeded my expectations. There's a surprising amount of tech - I think a lot of it is copied from the Any%, but there's some wrench-specific tricks. But more than that, the couch banter was just top notch. It wasn't quite a full-on sleep-deprived madness run, but it was definitely a reason to be glad of the return to in-person events.

Review: Coop speedruns are best when they actually involve lots of multitasking. This one mostly just needs two players, to do launches. Although useful for a few clips, the other two players more often act like a load, spending like half the runtime in idle mode so they can quickly respawn at the lead player to end levels. Combine it with just not much to talk about, leading to a lot of dead time, this was just a much worse run than I expected, given then participants.

Review: A better multi-hour JRPG run than most, even if not nearly as polished in fine-scale execution. The use of RNG prediction, and a bit of ad-hoc manipulation, was the only notable speed tech, but it's something I don't think I've seen before, and it's a nice compromise between samey fully-manipped runs, and tedious unmanipulated runs. It's a bit of a small couch for a run this long, but it entered the fun parts of the Sleep Deprivation Madness realm. And though the cutscene skipper doesn't *completely* eliminate downtime, there's still a lot more gameplay than most similar runs.

Review: Not too dissimilar to other Metal Gear runs we've seen. Tightly-routed movement to avoid the preset guard patterns, often walking right next to them. Precise hits to take down bosses as quickly as possible. A few small, glitchy skips, but nothing major. A few tedious autoscroller sections. All backed by a tight-knit couch running commentary. dlime's execution was clean as hell but the game in general just doesn't impress much, and even the runners seem annoyed at just how much of the game is rote.
