Review: A solid start to the marathon (even though I'm watching this in November, lol). Not very glitchy, but a good variety of tech, well-explained. And I hope other runs start copying the lore commentator idea, it could really help certain games.

Review: Bmups tend to be light on glitches, heavy on execution and routing, and this was no exception. It's a bit too new to have the meticulous polish most bmup runs have - in fact, Mike came fairly close to a game over at one point. He makes up for it with good commentary, including a nice dev on the couch. The combo exhibition afterward is probably interesting for SOR4 players but didn't seem too interesting to me.

Review: Fucking COVID, I swear. This run was seriously hurt by technical issues - namely, the runner is on satellite internet, so the game stream would occasionally freeze, then fast-forward through an entire level as it reconnected. This always happened during technical sections the couch had been trying to hype up, never during the autoscrollers. The saving grace was that the couch was watching the run on the same stream - combined with the runner not speaking past the intro, this gave a sort of reaction-video vibe, like we were watching the (quite excellent) couch watching the speedrun.

Review: I think there is a reason the speed community for this game is so small. Substantial differences between versions, constant Yorda RNG, tricks that are punishing to fail and can fail for seemingly no reason. This run spends maybe 10% of its runtime attempting a single trick, over and over. It's just not that interesting to watch.

Review: This was a really good run, bare seconds off WR. Commentary was really good except for two things that absolutely wrecked it for me - audio lag meant they were constantly talking over each other or reacting to things that happened half a minute ago, or the runner's kids were making noise and I couldn't make out what the runner or couch were saying. IDK how they were even audible, a headset mike shouldn't pick up much ambient noise, but the audio mix had them blowing out everything else. And fine, kids are cute and all, but fuck did it always happen at the worst possible points.

Review: Honestly, kind of a sloppy run all around. Lots of mistakes, on things that seemed fairly easy. Commentary was meandering and uninformative, mostly a running gag about the bad remakes. The host seemed to be barely paying attention. Even the crew was sloppy, missing the start timer by several seconds, and messing up some game info. If you're a THPS fan, you'll probably like this anyway, but it's not easy to like.

Review: This is going to be a polarizing run. On the one hand, BGB absolutely wrecked this game, blazing through everything in mere minutes with seemingly no trouble at all. And David Szymanski seemed to be doing enjoyable dev commentary, a bit heavy on the exaggerated "how are you breaking my game?" act, but occasionally he broke character and actually said something interesting. But fuck Dave Oshry. He just would not shut up, even when he had nothing worth saying. He seemed to think this was some kind of COVID-19-specific event, and kept trying to promote the game instead of the run. Same shit he pulled at AGDQ2020 with Amid Evil, except even more obnoxious. I don't think SomeNerdyNoob even got a word in the entire run. Absolutely none of the tech got explained. I'd have enjoyed this run more on mute.

Review: Ouch. This was rough. Runner did okay at explaining stuff, but was a bit lacking in charisma. The game isn't that competitive, and the speedrun is pretty loose - he pulled off some cool skips, but also messed up some simple gameplay. But the tech issues really killed it - long sections of audio cutting out, followed by minutes of the host talking over the runner, seemingly unknowingly. It just didn't work well.

Review: The perfect horror game speedrun for me - skipping all of the horror. Heavy use of out-of-bounds and a save loading glitch, so it bears almost no resemblance to casual gameplay. BloodThunder did pretty good on self-commentary, but the run itself had a couple hitches.

Review: A strange and interesting game, but perhaps not the best speed game. The route mostly seemed to be "grind for cash early, buy an OP weapon that wrecks all bosses". Other than that, it's mostly just "play the game good", and with no reference for baseline difficulty, it didn't seem all that impressive. Decent late-night filler, but still filler.

Review: This was a hard run to watch. It just completely failed to be interesting. Even now I can barely remember what happened in this. The story is anime nonsense *that the runners don't know*, the gameplay seems very straightforward, the route has no interesting tech or glitches, and nobody involved had any charisma. This is bad even for late-night filler.
NM: Apparently WR changed after I prepared this, or it's measured differently or something.

Review: A very straightforward run. It's almost all movement, the only combat of note is in the boss fights, which are annihilated in seconds. I don't think the runner did anything particularly wrong, it just was not interesting. Maybe it would have been fine as a half-hour run, but an hour of this, with no couch, was just too much.

Review: Speedrunning a game you got from a cereal box. It's exactly what you expect - terrible early-00s graphics, nonsensical story, awful movement but so many glitches that you barely use the intended movement anyways. A decent chunk of the run was missed due to tech issues, but what we did see was mostly good.

Review: Another really boring run to watch. It's a puzzle game, but the mechanics are not explained at all, I only partially followed by recalling his AGDQ run of the first game. About the only thing you *will* understand is when he messes up, which was not infrequent. And it's just not an impressive game to watch.

Review: RBO runs have to be pretty glitched, and there's more than a few glitches involved here.

Review: RPG runs come in two flavors - some are intricate, immaculately-polished marathons, others are completely busted glitchfests, getting to the end far faster than devs would have thought possible. Quest 64 is neither. It's glitched, but still hits most of the main bosses and so still needs tons of tedious grinding. But it's not meticulous - the glitches were inconsistent, the grinding was loosely-routed, and a lot of the battles still ended up being RNG nightmares. Even the commentary was poorly-planned - never explaining some of the basics of the gameplay, leaving most of the audience in the dark.

Review: A pretty good speedrun, but not great to watch. Commentary had some serious lag - they would start explaining an "upcoming" trick after it had already happened. Tonkotsu was silent after introducing himself - probably the right decision, but one that put even more burden on the couch, who failed to carry it. If you can watch a DKC2 run without commentary, you'll enjoy this one - he's clearly good at the game - but if you're not already familiar, this is a rough watch.

Review: Perhaps the most impressive thing about this run is that he managed top-notch commentary, by himself, for over an hour, while also putting down ridiculous times. Missed a few skips, but always managed to recover them. And stick around for the shortcut showcase afterward, some of those strats are insane.

Review: An excellent run, if a bit long. Never too much downtime though - while it doesn't have too many flashy, game-breaking glitches, it also doesn't have many unskippable cutscenes or tedious as-casual sections. It's three hours of nonstop small tricks, perfectly explained and well-executed.

Review: An execution-heavy run, with very few glitches or even skips. The game has great movement so it's interesting to watch, but not varied enough to really hold one's attention for a full hour. Also suffered more than most runs from being online - bad microphone quality, and audio latency leading to people frequently talking over each other by accident.

Review: A weird little game. Seems like a high skill ceiling, since it looks like the programmer just didn't put in a speed cap. Not too much tech besides a few cuts. Wish the commentary had been a bit better - seems like a bit of a language barrier - but it's mostly self-explanatory.

Review: IMO the best category of the game, glitched has too many zips to be interesting. Gameplay is really tight, but a few mistakes proved very costly. Some good pure platforming skill, but not too much of interest otherwise.
Invalidated by game over, necessitating level warp to complete run.

Review: I find it hard to review this run except by contrast to the previous. It's glitched, so there's some "underflow straight to end of level" zips, but not too many. It had more energy, more hype than the last run's laid-back style. But it was also just sloppier.

Review: Kind of a rough run to watch. Audio balance was awful - game audio completely drowned out runner and commentary for entire levels, and this game has some of the most annoying, screechy voiceacting I've ever endured. There's only a handful of interesting glitches, and the explanation of them was garbled and confusing. Maybe this is exciting for the people who've played this game (other than some odd deaths, his execution did seem pretty good), but I haven't, and it was not fun to get through.

So it's not a super optimized route, but the low-level gameplay is still classic Doom, so execution was still impressive. Good couch commentary and chemistry, too.

Review: An interesting comparison to classic Doom and nu Doom runs. Reminds me a bit of early Half-Life runs, lots of explosives-jumping and other momentum skips, combined with enemy memorization. Runner kept up good commentary (especially considering it was solo), but also roasted the game's aesthetics and enemy design.

Review: For those unfamiliar with the game, this run was incredibly hard to follow. I was never really sure what was going on, let alone understood the strategies involved. The commentary was either impeded by audio balance and a thick accent, or veered into jargon. If it was at least visually impressive, it could have been salvaged, but other than some polished movement, it looked like a lot of standing around shooting. I actually would like to see more non-speedrun showcases, just not like this.

Review: Rando runs are always great. Got some great couch interaction, good humor from the runners, and some crazy routing. Ended up going a bit over, because the seed was pretty obtuse, but I doubt anyone else would have done it faster.

Review: The first VR title run at GDQ, and it was definitely an experience. Not quite as broken as most Source runs, but that's not saying much - almost every level was beaten by clipping through, under, or over something, in more than a few ways so it never got old. A bit hard to watch, with the VR nausea, but I didn't have too much trouble with it.

Review: Ho. Ly. Shit. This run was insane. Masterful movement, flawless combat, a perfect mix of normal-gameplay execution and completely unintended skips. And on Nightmare! I can't even beat the first level on Nightmare, yet Bloodshot makes it look downright easy.

Review: Wow this was a rough watch. The game is kind of infamously broken, but the run doesn't show many cool tricks, just "oh yeah you can skip the entire level by jumping this way". Execution was a mess - about a quarter of the run was trying to get through one short section - and commentary was unenthusiastic. I've seen runners more hype while halfway through a six-hour RPG slog, how did this guy start out sounding so bored?

Review: This was an oddball run. It had the fast pace and bizarre gameplay that should have lent it the manic energy this GDQ has lacked, but it just... didn't. Things seemed very under-explained, like they assumed everyone is familiar with titles older than the average GDQ viewer. Didn't help that the runner had to keep quieting down so as not to disturb his kids... could have been a cute moment, but it just turned kind of awkward.

Review: Kind of a weak run. The difficulty was more than balanced out by the NG+ weapons, making it seem easy, and the glitches were few and minor. Even the strats were not super interesting - lots of "just run past the enemies", sometimes broken up with "use this really OP weapon to attack the weak spot". Not an awful run, but definitely one that can be skipped if you've never played HZD.

Review: And in classic SGDQ tradition, we get an obnoxiously long RPG run to cap things off. This hasn't been routed as methodically as other Pokegames, but that allowed some nifty talk about how they came to this route and contrasting it with alternatives. Runner and couch tried to muster the madcap end-of-marathon energy this run needed, and almost got there. But five hours is a long time to keep that going. Much like the marathon as a whole - I appreciate the attempt, but I'll be very glad to see in-person marathons start again.
