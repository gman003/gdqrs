Review: I think there's a reason this hasn't been run before. Lots of RNG, a fifteen-minute autoscroller, several unskippable cutscenes AND so many skippable cutscenes stacked in a row that they cut to donations... and after all that, there's just not much cool tech to the game. The same trick gets used on four of the bosses, another trick takes care of half the forced encounters, and there isn't even interesting movement besides manipulating guard AI. Jaguar King made a valiant attempt at keeping it interesting, but he'd have been better off running almost any other game.

There's two clips and a boss quick kill, but other than that there's barely any speed tech. This is deep in the filler hours, but it feels weak even as filler.

Review: This is a weird game. I wish they'd leaned in more to just how bizarre it is - the story, but also a lot of the gameplay. Some of that was due to the run being extremely fast-paced at the beginning, no time to explain anything, but then during the seven-minute autoscroller, they definitely could have done more than "lol aliens k donation time".

Review: When I saw specifically the Android version being run, I expected it to have some sort of run-making glitch. Turns out instead it's the most solid, glitchless Sonic run I've seen. And a WR? That seemed to take everybody by surprise, I certainly didn't think she was doing *that* well. (Note: My "Skill" rating is about how well the run shows off skilled play, not just how skilled the runner is.)

Review: This run was about as dull as expected. Skyrim's a great speed game, but glitchless? It's a hassle. It's a slog. It's just not particularly fun to watch, and I'm not really sure why this was an incentive run, and not 3AM filler. It's mostly movement (in a game with pretty clunky movement), routing, and luck. I've seen worse runs but I've also seen many better.

Review: A bit of a tough run to follow - no couch means the runners are on the hook to explain everything, and they were often too busy coordinating to do commentary. And it's also a complex game, lots of jargon that probably makes more sense to Diablo players. They did get the third WR of the day, but it seemed to be just as much luck as skill.
NB: Used the 3-player WR; the absolute WR is the same people plus blakjack at 1h20m52s.

Review: A quick little soulslike. Not too much variety to the tech, but it's quick enough that it never became a drudge. Doing the entire run at one hit from death certainly added to the tension, although perhaps such a game isn't quite marathon-safe. Invalidated by using a safety save, to avoid a five-minute retread after an unfortunate death.

Review: A surprisingly good JRPG run. There's a decent amount of tech - even though the only two tricks are item duping and OoB, there's a number of ways to go about them, and Chaos did a great job explaining them. The actual battles weren't too tightly scripted, this definitely isn't as competitive a speed game as others. But it's a more packed run, thanks to being under two hours.

Review: Is there such a thing as "too much energy"? I think this shows there is.

Which is a shame because as a dev *runner* he could have given some incredible commentary, but I literally can't recall one interesting thing he said.

Review: Eeehh, this run didn't work so well. It had the right pieces it just didn't put them together right. The game is kind of bad, and barely has any speed tech, so it needed great couch/commentary work to shine. Starwin tried to go for humor, but just kept repeating the one meme everyone's heard, over and over, on every boss fight. And he sort of tried to explain the lore and how this fits into the series, but didn't do enough of that to really interest you - particularly if you aren't a huge FotNS afficionado.

Review: Now this is what dev commentary should be. Lots of details, calling out incredibly obscure references, telling interesting stories about working with VAs or rightsholders, or even just how different pieces of the game came to be. Bahamut crushed the run, other than missing one statue he just blazed through it. Unfortunately we didn't get too much commentary on the actual run, but I suspect there wasn't an hour's worth of tech to explain, so it all worked out.

The runners turned it around but unless you've played Metroid and understand just how underequipped they are for every fight, it's not super fun to watch.

Review: Early Mega Man games are already brutally difficult. I've never beaten a single Robot Master. Coolkid decided that wasn't hard enough for him, so he played using only the base weapon, and then modded it so a single hit would kill him. He absolutely crushes it - taking only two hits. I'm not a huge fan of Mega Man runs, but this one is exceptional.

Review: Maybe I'm an outlier here, but I just don't find Tony Hawk games fun to watch. Like, they're collectathon platformers, essentially, and I could watch SM64 races all day long. But something about the density of these games makes them strangely dull to watch - the screen is full of junk to do, once an arbitrary amount are done you go somewhere else and do it again, and rarely does it seem skillful. As for this particular game... it's an eight-minute run. The level design has gotten so absurd that it's just eight minutes of doing wacky nonsense to get enough points to move on.

Review: A run that's broken in the best ways. Metroid Prime is pretty known for out-of-bounds shenanigans and sequence breaking, but 100% avoids almost all of the outright skips.

Review: Cuphead's become one of those perennial GDQ runs, like OoT and Celeste and Super Metroid. But I think, out of the games of that caliber, it's kind of the weakest as a speed game. It's a devilishly difficult game, and stuff like damage boosting to eke out a little bit more speed requires immense skill, but... the division between these top players and the casuals isn't how fast they are, it's how consistent they are, whether they can even beat the game. And that's just not nearly as interesting to watch, over and over. A perfectly fine run to watch if you've not seen Cuphead run before, but if you've seen it the past few GDQs, it's not a must-watch.

Review: The only problem with this run is that the top-level gameplay is too complex to possibly explain in just an hour.

But other than that, it's a great run, with great commentary and some fun meming for the casual watchers.

Review: This was a thing, I guess. The game sounds interesting but the run made it hard to tell - shouldn't rhythm games have the music cranked up? For a mostly-glitchless run, it was very unpolished; while roguelikes add random elements that make it hard to brutally optimize a run, this was leagues below the Hades run above. And neither runner nor commentator seemed to actually be interested in their own run?
NB: WR is for Njord Easy, didn't know there was an incentive for it when I grabbed records.

The only fun is the sheer baffling weirdness of the game itself - and to be fair, that part is fun. But it would have been more fun with at least a little context.

Perhaps it was just stage fright from being broadcast to millions of people?

Review: I think lengthy JRPG runs suffer the most under the pandemic.

Doing that with the friction of telepresence? Plexa and crew made a valiant effort but it was a doomed fight. His menuing was absolutely insane, and the commentary was pretty good... but there's only so long you can listen to donations while a cutscene plays out.

Review: Ah, shovelware tie-in games, how I don't miss you. Cheesy voiceacting, awful design, worse controls, and some truly inexplicable moments make for a decent Awful Block run. Clever idea, having a dev on the couch who's made a different and much better game on the same license - a bit underused in the role, but still good.

Review: The borders of Awful Block seem to be stretched more and more with each year. This is certainly not a great game but it's more weird than awful. It's a genre mishmash (which keeps the run interesting) and the story is bizarre, but that's hardly unusual for a '93 game. I suppose it fits better here than anywhere else - it's more about laughing at the weird bad game than about impressive speedrun skills - but this would probably have worked better in Silly Block.

Review: A rough end to Awful Block - tech issues meant we didn't see about a quarter of the run, and rythin didn't really seem able to narrate her run well. She seemed to be going for snarky but mostly came across as disinterested, and none of the numerous exploits were really explained, just "instead of actually beating the level I'm going to do this and now I'm at the end".

Review: This sounds like it should have been a ridiculous run, but somehow it underwhelmed. This is a brutally difficult game, but PeekingBoo managed to make it seem too easy. As far as I could tell, there were no concessions made for the unorthodox controller - same route as the normal speedrun - and with several levels being done first-try, it didn't add anything. Perhaps some commentary could have helped sell the difficulty, but with no couch, he frequently threw over to donations so he could focus. Understandable but still a detraction. It's still well worth watching if you've played the game, but it's not the jaw-dropping display I was hoping for.

Review: One of the more obscure Mario games (as much as that's possible), run by a champion and commentated by a legend. Too short to really shine, but you won't find many better runs under a quarter hour.

Review: A very difficult platformer getting wrecked. A bit unfortunate that there's only two characters used for most of the run, some more variety would have been nice, but other than that it's pretty interesting.

Review: A straightforward TAS, in contrast to the wacky antics a lot of TASblocks get up to. Unfortunately it also lasts a bit too long - half an hour doesn't seem like much, but most of the relevant tech is explained within the first few minutes, and then there's few interesting moments scattered among long swathes of fairly samey gameplay.

Review: Another pretty "normal" TAS, but much more distinct from the RTA run of the game compared to the last. Lots of tricks, even though this category goes out of its way to avoid the most broken. Commentary was perhaps low-energy but still quite informative - this is by far the better of the two TASBlock games in this event.

Review: A race held back by a large split that opened up early on, and never closed. That also impeded commentary, since one player would finish a section right as the other started it, no real overlap. Not crippling flaws, but this could have been a lot better.

Review: When a game bothers to have a "No Major Glitches" category, you know the glitched version is going to be bonkers. This doesn't quite get to the level of ACE, but damn if it didn't come close at times. And yet by requiring all dungeons be beaten, it's a decent-sized run, showing off a wider variety of tech.

Review: To watch four screens, covering a hundred and forty people, requires great commentary. What we got exceeded even that. Between Spike's play-by-play and GlitchCat's color commentary, it didn't even matter that none of the runners were miked up. They put on an excellent battle - even in the final few minutes, there were three people who could have won. About the only weak spot is that the game is effectively RNG-heavy, since so much depends on the random public players you're paired with. I think a rematch would still be anyone's game. But it's skill-based enough that the world's best Mario players were all pretty easily making it into the top three each round, and that made for an unforgettable show.

Review: A supreme Mario runner just absolutely crushes a difficult Mario romhack. Perhaps the only downside is that he blazed through it too fast for the commentary to really keep up.

Review: A run that's more about insane memory exploits than anything resembling traditional gameplay, but it's still a great watch. It's amazing just how much knowledge of the game you 
need, to *improvise* a recovery from a mistake in a run like this. And the Pokemon couch continues to be one of the most entertaining groups of people in speedrunning.
