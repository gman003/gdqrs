This is primarily a personal project, but you are welcome to help out if you want to.

These are the sort of things that would be helpful:
* Fixing browser compatibility issues
* Adding useful features, like linking runner names to their Twitch channel, or auto-skipping to the start of the run
* Improvements to accessibility or style

These are the things that I'm not interested in:
* Adding your own ratings - the ratings are subjective opinions, but they are *my* subjective opinions. If you want to use the same page for your own ratings, feel free to fork.
* Rewriting the whole thing in some overengineered framework - I want to keep this project simple and straightforward, an oasis away from the complex overwrought projects I work on. Strictly static, as few dependencies as possible.
* Adding ads, social media feeds, or trackers. GDQ supports *preventing* cancer, not spreading it.
