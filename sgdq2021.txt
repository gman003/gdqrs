Review: The only problem with speedrunning this game is that you miss out on all the great writing. Lots of busted platforming, a few skips that cut out like 90% of the game, and some good couch banter.

Review: This game has absolutely brilliant ILs - blindingly fast, impressively twitchy while also requiring precision - but a full-game run? It got tiresome and repetitive less than halfway through. They can't really go into enough depth on explanations while the run is ongoing, but that means the commentary was a long string of near-identical tricks. And there were significant problems with stream hitching from 1davidj, which is a problem in a game where things can move this quickly. A good run to watch until you get bored of it, not something you need to sit through in its entirety.

Review: One of the best races of the Covid era. Close throughout, never had the leader more than one mistake from falling behind, often trading places just off execution. Commentary was fast-paced but not as detailed as I'd have liked, had to go to the YT comments to understand one of the basic tricks.

Review: There's just not enough to this game. A few abilities are so clearly stronger than the others that it gets very samey, and there's only a few actual glitches. Maybe the execution is tricky, but it didn't manage to look like it, to someone who's played the game but briefly. Not a bad run but nothing special.

Review: Yet another ridiculously difficult rhythm game. But it's more obscure than Guitar Hero, at least over here, and unlike PIU it isn't obvious how difficult it is. With better camera and presentation, I feel it could have impressed further, but as it is, it's probably one of the weaker exhibition games. And the bitrate and knocking into the camera didn't help. Still cool though.
NM: Might be wrong on release year, couldn't find anything official. The 2013 figure came from a blog reviewing it.

Review: Look. It's a meme game. The main reason for this run was the cutscenes, and BlueMetal did a great job selecting the good ones while not dragging things on too much. The gameplay had some tricks but too much was just running around blowing things up... which sounds cool but was actually kinda tedious.

Review: A bit of a start-stop sort of run. There were bursts of interesting RNG manips, cool jumps, outright glitching, but also long periods of downtime that couldn't quite be filled. And it ended with a sudden credits warp, which felt anticlimactic.

Review: A run that spends a lot of time in the doldrums. Long loading screens, made worse by some mechanics that, if RNG is unfavorable, require you to enter and immediately exit a level. And even during actual gameplay, much of it is simply running through surprisingly empty levels, with not too much interesting tech involved. It feels like an MGS1 run, but worse in every meaningful way. Invalidated by not actually getting Tsuchinoko rank, due to a few deaths.

Review: Look, gamers are nerds. I don't have particularly high standards for public speaking abilities in these reviews. But if you're bringing someone in to be on your couch, and relying on them to explain tech or glitches, it would be nice if they could make it through a sentence without multiple pauses or restarts. I'm a die-hard Pikmin player and I've actually tried to speedrun the first game, and even I got confused by some of the explanations because of poor delivery.

Review: It's a stealth game, but at Easy and with speed strats, it doesn't even look like one. It's mostly clipping out of bounds or hopping around levels, including some very odd "find the level logic flowchart and just trigger the end" tricks. Fun, but it did get repetitive.

Review: A good speedrun, but with almost none of the accompaniment that makes a GDQ performance good. Story explanation? He can't even name all the characters. Tech explanations? Barely present, other than stating the obvious. No glitches. No really flashy tricks. Not even any good gags. This is like something from a decade ago, a very barebones "guy plays game fast" performance.

Review: This run did one thing, and did it well - played an old run-and-gun platformer with precision and skill. The commentary was capable but not very interesting, there were almost no glitches, the route is almost entirely fixed, and they did far less with the absurdity of the game than they could have. But if you want to see an 8-bit platformer get wrecked, this will do that for you.

Review: I was hype for this run, but it was a huge letdown. It was beset by technical issues - stream hitches and an absolutely awful microphone - but even if it hadn't been, it wouldn't have made for a great run. Sierra gave a lot of commentary but very little of it was good commentary. It was disordered, halting, mostly just confusing. And while the knowledge of the inner workings of the game was impressive, it didn't even require much in way of execution. Great work routing, no work needed for running.

Review: Perhaps if you've played this game, you could better appreciate the skill involved. But to an outsider, it kind of just looks like spamming the same busted move over and over. It's effectively glitchless, and the route is pretty linear, so this run comes down purely to execution. Which it did well, but still hard to hold your interest for a full hour.

Review: The good type of chill late-night run. Bloodthunder does a great job on self-commentary, I think it was half an hour in before he even had a breather for donations. The games aren't too super technical, but there's a lot of tricks and he explained them well, while also describing the story without spoiling too much. The run itself is super glitchy - if there's a wall, he's going to clip through it - but entertainingly so.

I could understand if it was obvious how one was going fast, but... unless you've played this game, you're going to have no idea whether this run was tediously slow or blazingly fast. Vynn did an excellent job at running a game that really is not suited for speed marathons.

Review: A weird but enjoyable combination - movement between bosses is very glitchy, and the order of bosses is nowhere near intended, but the actual fights are mostly done normally, save for using an overpowered post-game weapon. About the only drag is a few RNG grinds, but in this case, those were quite short.

Review: This run would have been fine if it were thirty minutes. Two hours is a bit much, for a lightly-glitched run like HZD - there's a lot of tech but almost none of it is interesting, just memorizing enemy locations and routing exactly how to best defeat them. And somehow, despite being on the highest difficulty, NG+ weapons are OP even up to the final boss and you can run through half the stealth sections. It could maybe have worked as a backdrop to couch shenanigans (Elkjaer ran solo) or in-depth discussion of the broader game (Elkjaer spent enough time saying "I can't cover the game's lore in two hours" to probably have covered the game's lore)

Review: We've seen several RE7 runs before. A race is a good way to shake it up, but it doesn't completely fix the problems with it as a speed game. Expect a lot of down time and cutscenes. As a race, it started strong - they were almost in sync for the first half-hour - but once one fell behind by a minute, from a small mistake, the positions never changed again.

Review: The game might be Resident Evil In Space, but the run certainly isn't. The main movement mechanic is a glitch, there's frequent out-of-bounds, a few entire chapters are skipped almost entirely. The run is not quite as polished as many other games, but it seems like it's evolving quickly. This might be a new classic speed game.

Review: A bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lot of OoB, messing with level loading, and unintended platforming. On the other hand, a lot of the run was just "run past enemies, completely ignoring them", and that gets real old when you're pushing two hours. The thing that tipped me over into liking it was the couch - mixing "former recordholder" with "guy who used to casual this game" made for some great interaction.

Review: Long RPG runs are a different sort of speedrun. This one doesn't have much in the way of large skips - a few dungeons get heavily shortcutted, at most, and mostly via variations on a single glitch. But, it's an RPG that allows for blazing-fast menuing, and Plexa has mastered it. And like any good RPG run, there's plenty of knowledge on display, as well as some genuine love for the game. If the six-hour runtime doesn't scare you, it's a worthwhile watch.

Review: Keeping with the theme, this is only occasionally a racing game speedrun. Mostly, it's a wrecking game speedrun - tricking the AI, somehow, into destroying itself and handing you the win. On the rare occasion racing is actually needed, a glitch with drifting makes it almost trivial. Being AI manips, they're not super consistent, but it's funny enough for this hybrid Racing/Silly block.
Critique: Okay, since I know the runner will actually be reading this, a constructive critique as well as a review are in order. Everyone other than Martinz, you can stop reading, this won't be relevant to you. The biggest problem I had was just that you and Chazoshtare kept talking over each other. I don't know how much lag you had on the voice chat, but it was definitely disruptive. You repeated your explanations enough that I eventually got it all, but it took longer than needed. This has been a problem for a lot of runs since they started going online-only, but others have figured out how to minimize it - I'd suggest asking around, see how they've been doing it. Secondly, I'd suggest working on your delivery - there were a lot of funny things going on, and you were telling some jokes that could have been funny, but your timing was off and your delivery lacked confidence. You probably just need practice here. You were also let down quite a bit by Chaz's commentary - he didn't seem to add much that was interesting, and he stumbled over his words quite often (which strangely, he didn't do in his self-commentated IWBTKISA run). I think this was more him than you talking about it, but I also question the choice to focus on explaining the story - yes, it's a bonkers story with a lot of things to laugh at, but I think the story explanations overshadowed the actual speedrun explanations. Every other complaint I have is more about the game than your run, it's not like you can change the fact that most of the run is AI manips to force them to wreck, which did start to feel repetitive towards the end.

Review: I am disappointed that the MMMMMMMMMM meme didn't seem to last past Racing Game Block. I'm sure if this had been a live event, we'd have gotten the crowd doing it for the next three days. As for the actual run... it's a ridiculous gimmick of a game that makes it absolutely hilarious to watch. There's no speed tech beyond "play game well", and I'm not entirely sure Chaz *did*, but the game is so unlike everything else that I can't really tell.
Critique: And this run is why I pin most of the blame for the bad commentary for Paris Chase on Chaz, not Martinz - because when Chaz wasn't able to talk, things went incredibly well. As far as commentary went, I have nothing bad to say, it did everything it needed to and did it well - it explained everything worth explaining, told every joke that was worth telling, but never got in the way. I'm sure you still have room to improve but fuck if I can tell you how. Should I ever somehow put on a run at GDQ, I'd be glad to have you on my couch.

Review: Another run where things were just really hard to follow and understand.

We got a lot of info - there's a multi-minute gameplay primer before the run starts - but didn't actually learn much.

Review: This feels a lot like a GoldSrc run, but not quite. The precision of shooting, and the difficulty of some of the route, make it a very skill-focused run. It's not very glitchy, other than saveloading to speed up some animations and a few clips, but it does use a lot of bhopping. Unfortunately, it just drags on a lot longer than Heros was able to talk about it - I think the back half was more donations than commentary.

Review: I actually played Contrast relatively recently. Sank triple the run's time into it, and didn't even make it past the first act. So I can confirm the run is exactly as busted as it looks, with constant clips, OoB, and sequence breaking. Zic's commentary near the start was good, but later on Nally took over, but her audio mix was incredibly bad. I could barely hear her over the game audio. It would have been a good run to wake up to - chill vibes but still lots of in-game shenanigans - but it fell short of its potential.

Review: The risk you always run with races, especially of less-popular games, is that they might be uncompetitive, one racer clearly ahead for the entire run. That's what happened here - I think it would have been better as a solo run. Commentary was good but drowned out by game audio - I know Game Boy audio is highly compressed, hard to balance well with regular audio, but this was extremely hard to listen to at times.

Review: A nice, tightly-routed bmup. Very little in the way of glitches, and there's not too much variety in the tech, but it has a good tension running through it. The fastest way to play is to use special moves excessively, but that leaves you just a hit away from death, and whenever things start to go off-script, it's nail-biting. The combo exhibition afterward is purely for SoR4 fans, though - Bill gives very little commentary, and messes up a lot more than in his main run.

Review: This was not the run I expected. The strats all sound dumb, but they work - most of the army gets suicided at the first possible chance, just to cut down on menuing; the sole survivor is kept deliberately underleveled until the timeskip, to take advantage of free level-ups; somehow *Sylvain* is the linchpin of the Crimson Flowers run, which is why fem!Byleth is somehow speed tech. But there's a lot more RNG, and far fewer memes in commentary, than I expected. The race was tighter than the end times make it look (last-minute RNG screwed one over), the commentary did a good job explaining all the strats, and just watching the menuing was kind of crazy.
Original Review: Look, I put a hundred hours into this game last year and obsessively refreshed the screen all day, hoping Crimson Flower would win the bidwar (Edelgard von Hresvelg did nothing wrong!). My opinion here is *not* going to be unbiased. I was torn between giving it an ironic negative twenty stars for killing off all my favorite characters but then saving some of my most hated, and giving it five stars ahead of time for being the run I was most looking forward to. But if I'm going to pretend to be objective... it's a turn-based strategy run with blindingly-fast menuing, some dumb-but-they-work strats, a heap of RNG, and nowhere near as many memes as I had expected, given this fandom. The race was tighter than the final times make it look (one runner got screwed on literally the last turn of the last map), and some of the strategies in play were interesting and explained as well as possible in the brief moment they had.

Review: I'm not really sure what they thought they were doing with this run. It's a collection of silly minigames, with a heavy emphasis on mashing, but they commentated as if it were a serious, technical run. Yet I was still frequently confused - why were some minigames repeated? Why weren't others that didn't get an SSS rank, which they had said was the definition of 100%? This run feels like it called for more casual commentary, silly-block energy, but that's not what they went for, and I think the run suffered for it.

Review: Where to start with this one? Once again, we got the wrong sort of commentary - stiff, sportsy, technical explanations, that this run doesn't seem to justify. It was a weak race - that minute spread was caused by repeatedly failing a trick in the first stage, and Jaxler actually gave better commentary than the Jackalacka on the couch. And the any% category involves repeating one relatively boring trick several times in a row, to skip multiple levels - it would have been slower, but more interesting, to actually play those levels. They had already deviated from the WR Any% route, playing through one level rather than using a risky skip, so why not just play the All Stages category?

Review: We've seen plenty of Mega Man X runs. This is not the best, but still not bad. The couch was good when they weren't talking over each other, and Luiz pulled off a few impressive-looking tricks.

Review: One of the roughest runs of this event. Tako seemed unable to both play the game and commentate at the same time, and ended up doing badly at both. Lots of mistakes, he seemed to barely scrape past the finish line, and even when it went well, the speedrun didn't seem that interesting or polished. His commentary was frequently pointless, just describing the things that were happening on screen, without adding any insight or explanation, and his ceaseless monotone made him seem as bored as I was.

Review: A substantially better run - maybe Tako is more experienced with it, or maybe he just needed someone to commentate and let him focus on gameplay, but either way, this one was actually decent. Aside from some horrendous audio mixing at the start - the first minute or so of explanations were absolutely inaudible over the game music, but it's fixed shortly.

Review: A long RPG run needs two things to be good: displays of ridiculously deep knowledge of the game by the runner, and entertaining antics with the couch and host during the dull bits. This delivered well on both. Amoeba casually rattles off chains of responses to battle RNG, like a chess player describing variations on the Sicilian. And when there wasn't much to say about the run, we got some amazing voiceacting from Edobeah to keep things fun.

Review: A surprisingly good speedrun, considering how new the game is. Fir's execution wasn't the greatest but the route and tech already looks quite interesting, and he gave an absolutely hilarious explanation of some of the mechanics - perhaps the greatest use of props since Tomato's Fallout Anthology run back in AGDQ2020. Definitely a game to keep an eye on.

Review: There is a reason Super Metroid races used to be the traditional GDQ grand finale - it's a great speed game, with a community that can give absolutely top-notch commentary. Antinomy and Hockey put in possibly the best couch work of the Covid era, backing three of the best SM runners.

Review: If you're a fan of the genre and want to see DS3 get wrecked, this will probably entertain. If you're more an outsider to the series, or even unfamiliar entirely, this probably won't do much for you. Commentary kind of explains what's going on but doesn't do a good job selling the difficulty, nor does the game itself.

Review: Ashewyn makes the interesting choice to focus on explaining the lore as much as explaining the speed tech or strats. This could maybe have paid off, if it hadn't fairly quickly started to blur together. So instead we're left with a run that's not super polished (as expected of a game this new), with commentary that doesn't do enough to hold interest on its own. If you're a From Software fan, you'll probably still enjoy it, but for everyone else, this will probably feel like late-night filler.

Review: Coop is about the only way this game, and especially category, is watchable. There's just too many autoscrollers. It needs the vocal on-the-fly rerouting and the bromantic tension to actually be a good speed game. But Mitch and Haxor deliver on both fronts, putting on an entertaining - and powerful - performance.

Review: Mitch goes for almost all the ridiculous marathon-unsafe strats, and gets some of them. At twelve minutes, it doesn't grate too much that eight of them were spent on autoscrollers, but it's definitely a step down from the coop run.

Review: A good callback to the first Games Done Quick, and a good way to cap off the marathon. Staying at level 1, on the hardest difficulty, is something only Kingdom Hearts can really do, because it compensates for your lack of damage... but there's just about zero margin for error in the entire back half of the run. Ninten messed up just often enough to give a sense of how easy it is to slip up and die instantly, never enough to feel dull or disheartening. The run's not quite as deep as most long RPG runs, but SpikeVegeta shows why he's the king of the couch, hitting with both sportscaster-grade running commentary and entertaining banter. The post-run bonus fights are probably cool for those who've played a Kingdom Heart, but for the rest of us, the added difficulty doesn't come through, you can probably skip those.
