Review: An impressive run - most of the time loss was just to insisting on showing off the coolest possible strats. Almost every chamber had something neat, and the energy just never flagged the entire time.

Review: A pair of absurdly tough custom maps, focusing on rapid execution. It's not as interesting as the main run, but still impressive when he finally gets it.

Review: A weird sort of roguelike / bingo thing, completing certain arbitrary tasks within a randomized environment. But also controlling up to four characters at once. It's certainly unique, but not always easy to follow, nor the most interesting gameplay to watch.

Review: A very dry, technical sort of run. There's no individually huge strat, besides obtaining the saber, but there's constant little strats to save time. Good if you want a super-serious sort of run.

Review: It's a fun run. Seeing someone adapt and route things on the fly is what makes randomizers fun, and there's plenty of that here. And in the late game, there's a ton of really fast, polished movement. It suffers a bit from repetition in the mid-game, but was still an enjoyable watch.

Review: There were at least three tricks here that seem straight-up impossible. Unbuffered superswimming, barrier skip, some crazy zombie hovers. Even having seen plenty of Wind Waker speedruns before, my jaw was on the floor.

Review: Strictly as a speedrun, there's not much to see here. It's mostly just running from point to point, with little in the way of tech or even combat. But as an extended joke about the surreal story of Alan Wake (and the wider Remedyverse), it's hilarious. What's going on? Something inexplicable. What does that mean? Don't worry about it!

Review: Compared to the previous DLC in the previous run, this one has more speed tech (read: any speed tech). But the story is a bit more grounded, so the outsider surrogate on the couch spends less time being baffled to (comic) tears.
