Review: A weird sort of roguelike / bingo thing, completing certain arbitrary tasks within a randomized environment. But also controlling up to four characters at once. It's certainly unique, but not always easy to follow, nor the most interesting gameplay to watch.

Review: A very dry, technical sort of run. There's no individually huge strat, besides obtaining the saber, but there's constant little strats to save time. Good if you want a super-serious sort of run.

Review: It's a fun run. Seeing someone adapt and route things on the fly is what makes randomizers fun, and there's plenty of that here. And in the late game, there's a ton of really fast, polished movement. It suffers a bit from repetition in the mid-game, but was still an enjoyable watch.

Review: Strictly as a speedrun, there's not much to see here. It's mostly just running from point to point, with little in the way of tech or even combat. But as an extended joke about the surreal story of Alan Wake (and the wider Remedyverse), it's hilarious. What's going on? Something inexplicable. What does that mean? Don't worry about it!

Review: An interesting sort of kart platformer. Unexpectedly good, not as busted as you'd expect from a Europe-only partial PC port of a Wii game, but still having well-developed speed tech. One run invalidated by a softlock, just started the next level in sync with the other runner instead of restarting.

Review: Kaizo SMW is always a treat. This one was maybe not the smoothest run, but with a game that's hard even by kaizo standards, that's hardly unexpected. We get lots and lots of shell tech, and a few really neat gimmick levels.

Review: This is the most impressive Ratchet run I think I've seen at GDQ. There's some cool glitches, a lot of technical gameplay optimization, and some very efficient routing. But wow, three hours is more Ratchet than I needed. Do stick around for the post-run opera performance though - it's only a leaderboard of three, but I'd put this as the best opera singing at a GDQ.

Review: There was really only one impressive segment in this run, a combat arena towards the end. It was a really good segment - but I'm not sure it was worth all the buildup. I'm sure the cinematic scenes were wonderful casually, built up great characters, but in a speedrun they just come across as wasting our time.

Review: As expected of a glitchless horror run, it's mostly dodging past mob spawns while flitting from one inexplicable puzzle to another, punctuated by a handful of boss fights. Most of the enjoyment is going to come either from explaining the lore, or ribbing the game, and this is a prime candidate for both.

Review: A basic but competent run. Did you enjoy Shadow Generations, and want to see it played better than you did? AlphaDolphin plays much better than you, and adds in a few skips and tricks to go even faster. But it's not a speedrun that's had much time to really be worked out, yet, feels too close to a casual run. But all the series lore being explained was fun enough.

Something for the real Pokemaniacs, but if you've never liked the series, this won't be the run to change your mind.

Review: It's easy to forget that, as great as Spike is on the couch, he's also a really good speedrunner. When he's not goofing off in this run, he's pulling off some pretty sick platforming. And then he gets distracted doing a bit, and you see just how easy it is to screw up. I'm planning to watch it again just to pay more attention to the actual speedrunning, not the top-notch couch banter - and the run was so good, that even though it happened less than an hour ago, I'm still down to watch it again.

Review: I don't even know where to start, with this run. On the speedrun side, you've got some workhorse glitches that break the game wide open, turn the "All Romances" into a flit around the map. And then on the shenanigans side - prop comedy, witty banter, some cheeky shade at the family-friendly event rules they're playing under. An overall excellent speedrun.

Review: I got tired of this showcase, long before it finished. I think there were just too many maps focused on consistency and endurance, rather than a quick flash of skill. It all blurred together before the halfway mark. Yes, seeing someone fly a car like this is stunning at first - I *have* played Rocket League, I could never pull this off - but an hour of it was more than I could take.

Review: A mess of a run. It's about 90% staring at the save menu or loading screens, for reasons that perhaps can't be easily explained but no attempt was made. Something went wrong, or maybe even several somethings, but even that was inscrutable. No amount of wild cheering for the phrase "horse tilt" could make this enjoyable.

Review: Somehow a step down from the main run, and just as far over estimate. If things had gone *properly*, we'd still have been staring at an alchemy menu for multiple minutes while grinding levels, even with all the glitches active. Things did not go properly. Invalidated (though this doesn't even seem to be a real category) by using console commands to bypass a trick that kept failing.

Review: Kicking off Awful Block with one of the vintage Worst Games. The game is suitably broken, with wall clips in pretty much every indoor level, and the run has a pretty fast route, to boot. Unfortunately, the best individual piece of speed tech is setting the screen size to 20%, to reduce (but somehow not eliminate) lag. So expect to squint a lot.

Review: The challenge from this run is more like a rhythm game than most JRPGs. The battle strats are unremarkable, but pulling off the attack/parry minigames? Wow. We also got some glitches, skipping enough to make sure they were always underleveled. It's a very unique run - besides other M&L runs. Even among those, this one stands out.

Review: Maybe I missed a crucial, never-repeated explanation, or maybe this is just a game that only makes sense once you've played it, but I just couldn't follow this run beyond the extremely basic "move and kill enemies". It wasn't information overload, or moving too fast, I just couldn't get a mental foothold. But it's got smooth movement and some roguelike builds, enough to keep me watching even without understanding.

Review: Well. It's a massive game, and requiring all dungeons actually be beaten ensures we see a good amount of it. But it's still an exploit-dense run, using all manner of glitches that are not easy to explain. It's well-commentated, not too hard to follow, but it's more a careful dismantling of the game than a kinetic blitz.

Review: It's a limited speedrun - there's a few skips, but it's mostly manipulating ally AI to advance faster, or quick strats to tear through firefights. And there's more than a few long autoscrollers. But it's a couch full of charisma and they came prepared, so it's still a banging time.

Review: Rhythm game showcases are a narrow tightrope to walk. You need to do things that are impressive, even for people who've never heard of the game before it shows up on the schedule. But you also need to do enough different things, to fill out your time slot without turning into repetition, and that's where I find a lot of these Japanese rhythm games falter. This one, too, turns into a soup of unreadable colors and a barrage of electronica runs, but only towards the end. In the main run, there's some recognizable meme songs and some variety in the challenge that even newcomers can see - they saved the stuff that only makes sense to serious players, for the second showcase.
