Review: It's a fun run. Seeing someone adapt and route things on the fly is what makes randomizers fun, and there's plenty of that here. And in the late game, there's a ton of really fast, polished movement. It suffers a bit from repetition in the mid-game, but was still an enjoyable watch.

But as an extended joke about the surreal story of Alan Wake (and the wider Remedyverse), it's hilarious. What's going on? Something inexplicable. What does that mean? Don't worry about it!

Review: I don't know if something was wrong with the video capture, or if the game's just like that, but it was too dark to see much, for much of the run. I felt similarly about the commentary - sure, it was there, it described what was going on, but it didn't do much to explain *why*. There were a few good couch gags, but overall, it's a run that's just sort of there.

Review: Just kind of too long a run, for what it has to offer. There's one important trick, repeated several times. For most of the run, the normal gameplay challenge is suspended, enemies can't damage you so it's just running to get keys. If this had been half as long, it wouldn't have worn out its tricks, but as it is, feels very padded-out.

Review: This is a run, I think, almost exclusively for the Madoka Magica fans. If you know the game, or even the anime, this is probably quite enjoyable. But, uh, it took me longer than I care to admit to even realize this was a tie-in game. If you were expecting Froob's typical buttery-smooth, outsider-aimed introduction and play-by-play, you won't find it here. Instead, we got a passionate, heartfelt, but very niche run.

Review: It's a pretty by-the-books collectathon platformer - mix of 2D, 3D, and autorunner stages, though the speedrun focuses on the 2D. The run is solid, the only trick it didn't nail was an impossibly hard one, and attempting it did a great job showing the skill involved. I can't say this run did anything I haven't seen before, but it did everything well, and had enough variety to sustain even an hour-long run.

Review: The on-screen action is only sometimes scrutable, thanks to the game's focus on opaque clues that the speedrun entirely ignores. But other times it's a simple action-platformer, and it's always a good vessel for jokes and hardboiled noir accents, so it's still a good time.

Review: There's several ways to make a run interesting to watch, for multiple hours. It can be a run jam-packed with different tricks and tech that need to be explained - this one relied on one weapon for most of the run, and spent more time just walking to fights than in them. It can delve deep into the story, explaining what's going on in all those cutscenes being skipped - this has worked well for previous runs of the series, but was absent here. If all else fails, you can lean on couch banter and jokes, but even that was notably absent. I think we heard more from the donation reader than the runner. There's just not much to appeal to you here, unless you really, *really* like Yakuza.

Review: This is kind of just a slog of a run, even with a mod to skip through time.

There were only two real glitches used in the entire thing, everything else played straight. We did get some quality story primer, and enough couch banter to keep it engaging, but it's still a long, slow-paced run.

It's not super technical or polished, but it doesn't need to be - it's just good platforming.

But wow, three hours is more Ratchet than I needed. Do stick around for the post-run opera performance though - it's only a leaderboard of three, but I'd put this as the best opera singing at a GDQ.

Review: As expected of a glitchless horror run, it's mostly dodging past mob spawns while flitting from one inexplicable puzzle to another, punctuated by a handful of boss fights.

Review: With cutscenes and door transitions skipped, and some features lifted from later games, this was like a better version of other Resident Evil 1 runs. But somehow, it still felt thin, too much time thrown over to donations because the gameplay wasn't deemed interesting enough to talk about. Still a fun watch for Rezzy fans, but skippable if you're not.

Review: A weird spinoff of the franchise, free first-person movement but light-gun(-ish) shooting mechanics. The speedrun is heavily based on avoiding enemies entirely, exploiting some eccentricities of that gameplay formula. If you find other RE runs boring for how often they bypass zombies instead of shooting, this one takes that to extremes.

Review: The word that sums this run up best, I think, is "stiff". The runner's vtuber model may as well have been a static PNG. The commentator mostly stuck to a barebones play-by-play of the story, in correct but awkward English. The gameplay was skillful, so far as I could tell, but unless you could follow along with the commentary muted, you will probably find the full package lacking.

Review: The fun in coop runs usually comes from the multitasking, dividing the game up into pieces that can be taken on simultaneously. This was mostly one player at a time, sometimes two. Even for boss fights, one player would dip out. Without that, the run still stands up, but it doesn't stand out. Invalidated by needing a safety save after dying to a boss.

Review: A basic but competent run. Did you enjoy Shadow Generations, and want to see it played better than you did? AlphaDolphin plays much better than you, and adds in a few skips and tricks to go even faster. But it's not a speedrun that's had much time to really be worked out, yet, feels too close to a casual run. But all the series lore being explained was fun enough.

Review: It's easy to forget that, as great as Spike is on the couch, he's also a really good speedrunner. When he's not goofing off in this run, he's pulling off some pretty sick platforming. And then he gets distracted doing a bit, and you see just how easy it is to screw up. I'm planning to watch it again just to pay more attention to the actual speedrunning, not the top-notch couch banter - and the run was so good, that even though it happened less than an hour ago, I'm still down to watch it again.

Review: Kicking off Awful Block with one of the vintage Worst Games. The game is suitably broken, with wall clips in pretty much every indoor level, and the run has a pretty fast route, to boot. Unfortunately, the best individual piece of speed tech is setting the screen size to 20%, to reduce (but somehow not eliminate) lag. So expect to squint a lot.

Review: It's an absolute chaos fest. Attacks come in with no warning from all directions, bombs bounce around randomly, and many speedrunner noises are made. It feels more like a casual run than a speedrun, but it's still a good casual run.

Review: It's a Simpsons gag, expanded into a deliberately-clunky fangame. Somehow the speedrun is decent, but the comedy is the star of the show. The couch mostly just lets the game's inherent joke shine through, no need to distract it with their own antics, and for a ten-minute run, it's pretty great.

Review: This run was unfortunately, quite disappointing. Not just because a few bosses kept going awry, and blowing past the estimate. Mostly because, well, the commentary didn't do much. The series is famously bizarre and surreal, I'd have loved to hear about what was going on, or who these characters were. Failing that, explaining the strategies being used, might have carried it. We didn't get that, either.

Review: The challenge from this run is more like a rhythm game than most JRPGs. The battle strats are unremarkable, but pulling off the attack/parry minigames? Wow. We also got some glitches, skipping enough to make sure they were always underleveled. It's a very unique run - besides other M&L runs. Even among those, this one stands out.

Review: Maybe I missed a crucial, never-repeated explanation, or maybe this is just a game that only makes sense once you've played it, but I just couldn't follow this run beyond the extremely basic "move and kill enemies". It wasn't information overload, or moving too fast, I just couldn't get a mental foothold. But it's got smooth movement and some roguelike builds, enough to keep me watching even without understanding.

Review: Well. It's a massive game, and requiring all dungeons actually be beaten ensures we see a good amount of it. But it's still an exploit-dense run, using all manner of glitches that are not easy to explain. It's well-commentated, not too hard to follow, but it's more a careful dismantling of the game than a kinetic blitz.

Review: It's a limited speedrun - there's a few skips, but it's mostly manipulating ally AI to advance faster, or quick strats to tear through firefights. And there's more than a few long autoscrollers. But it's a couch full of charisma and they came prepared, so it's still a banging time.

Review: Rhythm game showcases are a narrow tightrope to walk. You need to do things that are impressive, even for people who've never heard of the game before it shows up on the schedule. But you also need to do enough different things, to fill out your time slot without turning into repetition, and that's where I find a lot of these Japanese rhythm games falter. This one, too, turns into a soup of unreadable colors and a barrage of electronica runs, but only towards the end. In the main run, there's some recognizable meme songs and some variety in the challenge that even newcomers can see - they saved the stuff that only makes sense to serious players, for the second showcase.

Review: I'm sure this run will seem even more impressive once I play the game myself, but even as an outsider, it's got appeal. A brisk pace, quick inputs that still need precision, and it's obvious the route for this took some careful planning, even if I don't know what exactly that entailed. I'm not sure exactly who such a unique game's speedrun appeals to - maybe puzzle gamers? I got some Hitman vibes as well. But it's a short enough run, go ahead and take the gamble on it.

Review: Between audio mix issues, mumbling into microphones, and the language barrier, I could not understand a *single* complete sentence, from the time the run started to when the run ended. It was, literally, incomprehensible. With no commentary to explain the game or the run or the strats, we're left relying on the gameplay to speak for itself. And I'm sorry, but it looks bad here, too. It's a beat-em-up with no real combos, no effort to stack enemies together, bosses melt in seconds but seem to be just because the game is easy. If there was more to it than that, it was on the couch to explain.

Review: This would have been a pretty good run, if anyone involved had felt at all enthusiastic about it. But they just didn't. Doing well, messing up, all done with the same tired monotone. I'm not sure if it was the remoteness, the language barrier, or just scheduling at the wrong hours, but it's hard to care about a run when it doesn't feel like the runner does. Which is a shame, because the speedrun didn't look that bad.

Review: A hard-mode mod of the game, this is a run of highs and lows. When it's working right, it's a more intense, interesting version of the normal Any%. But when things are going wrong - and they often went wrong - they turn into long sequences of retrying, or falling back to safety saves. If the failures were due to the difficulty of the mod, that would be one thing, but most of them were technical, or RNG. Runner and couch did the best they could, but the game just wasn't cooperating today. The Loosened Vice mod showcase afterward was moderately funny, but not really a speedrun, and the mood was pretty dead by that point.

Review: A new feature to the GDQ main stage, this time they're playing random, usually bargain-bin games from the PS1. There's a strong advantage to those that have played them before, instead of going in blind, and each round is too brief to really develop a feel for each game, so don't expect top-notch gameplay. But as a goofy sort of showcase? It's pretty great, actually.

Review: It's a filler run, but it's high-quality filler. Even with no attachment to the franchise, it's got little tricks and strats everywhere to call out, even if few of them are all that impressive. And if you happen to like these games, I'm sure you'll have a blast.

Review: One might expect a tie-in game to a movie spinoff of a Nickelodeon cartoon to be an avenue for silly antics and joking around. No. These runners are dead serious about this game, it's nonstop tech explainers. If you're down for that, it's a well-polished, technical run.

Review: It's a long run with a very careful route to follow. Almost every fight has something that needs to be pointed out, some threat they have to work around (or just hope to get lucky on). But it's also three hours of friends goofing around and joking, to fill the dead time inevitable in such a long run.

Review: What do you do if you have a run that mostly speaks for itself? Let it speak for itself, while putting on the loudest spectacle possible. It's half speedrun, half punk-rock concert. I don't even like punk and I had a blast.

Review: In a normal randomizer speedrun, glitches are used to try to save time, maybe get ahead of where the logic expected you to be. Here, it's mandatory. It takes an absolute wealth of game knowledge, and a skill at improvisation, to finish this at all, let alone in a marathon.

Review: It's still a developing speedrun, but already, there's some major skips involved. The execution might not be polished to a shine, but Glubbers presents them very well. Add in some finale hype, and you've got a wonderful run.

Review: Four of the top-level runners, racing through the most randomized randomizer I think we've seen. And even after an hour, first place came down to the second. The commentary plays second fiddle to banter and trash-talk, but it's fun trash-talk - though I do wish we had at least a basic tracker somewhere. Still, an excellent end to the marathon.
