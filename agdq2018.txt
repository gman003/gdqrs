Review: A robust start to the marathon, though seeing it after much more recent runs was strange. Techniques later runs had mastered, were here new and rough - but that actually made it more engaging, because they showed just how hard they are to learn.

Review: This just doesn't seem to be a good speed game, at least not with the current run. Lots of cutscenes, lots of tedious combat, pretty limited speed tech, not much polish. The couch being basically dead made things worse, leaving the runner to fill the frequent dead time alone.

Review: It's a big pile of glitches, as you'd expect. Commentary stayed pretty shallow, enough to follow along but not technical enough for my tastes. It hit a few rough spots (like needing a god mode cheat to get through one fight), but still a fun watch.

Review: This run just didn't do much memorable. There's some items skipped, but didn't seem to be much of the game. Bosses got melted fairly quickly, but most of the game was level traversal, and there wasn't a huge amount of tech for it. It's a perfectly okay run, Blaster Master fans will likely enjoy, but it's not going to pull in many outsiders.

Review: This is just far too long a run, for what it actually has. The platforming is pretty simple, nothing you haven't seen in other speedruns. It's not polished to a level that can sustain interest for ninety minutes, and the effectively solo commentary isn't going to fill that gap.

Review: It's an indie pixel-art metroidvania, and it comes with all the stuff you'd expect - sequence breaks, skipping items, burning down a few bosses. It doesn't do anything particularly special, and dragged a bit long for what I thought it had, but if you like indie metroidvania runs, this is a solid one.

Review: A late-era run-and-gun, but without the creeping complexity you usually find. I think I'd have liked it much better, were it not for all the autoscrollers, but even setting them aside, the run just felt like it was missing things. The story primer was "I don't know what's going on", the speed tech was limited, the couch didn't even get miked up.

Review: The movement tech has some neat momentum, but the levels are so short (when played at this level) that the run never gets a chance to build any. It feels like half the run is watching the score tickdown at the end of each level - which is a shame, because the gameplay actually looks really good.

Review: It's very obscure game, Japan-only. The speedrun is pretty typical of action-platformers, some damage-boosts to skip platforming, some skips, some boss strats. Nothing special, but excellent work on couch and commentary puts it a bit above the rest.

Review: No crazy glitch tech here. Well, okay, a little glitch tech, once or twice. As a treat. Mostly it's just play game good, little microoptimizations, cut the corners as tight as possible. The gap between runners only really opened up in the last third, it was really tight for most of the run.

Review: A tour de force in wrong-warping, but I think I'd have enjoyed a long primer on how the tech works, more than I enjoyed the run itself. It's a normal (if playing some often-skipped levels) DKC speedrun peppered with some opaque, repetitive tricks, which the runner sometimes struggled with.

Review: There were just too many autoscrollers, too much dead time, for this to really shine. Neat Sonic gameplay, more or less glitchless, but nothing too precise or polished. It would have tested its welcome even if it had skipped the credits sequence and special stages. With them? You'll have to be a big Sonic fan to love it.

Review: IMO the best run of Sonic Block this year. Good clean gameplay, pressing close enough to the edge that the occasional mistake just pressed home how hard this is. Just enough glitches to spice things up, mostly skipping cutscenes. And phenomenal commentary, more than making up for the quiet runner.
