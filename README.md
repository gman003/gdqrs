Games Done Quick Reviewed Slow
====

For years now, I've been watching the Games Done Quick charity speedrunning marathons. Out of idle boredom, I started doing rankings and reviews of each run. Then I started posting them to certain forums I'm on. And then people started asking me for more reviews.

I figure it's about time I actually make a site to show them all.

So that's what this is.

The project is in somewhat early phases right now. Right now, it only includes my reviews from SGDQ2021, which I have not yet finished watching. Previous reviews will go up once the main site has a bit more polish - there are many features I would like to add. But it's good enough now that I'd like people to be able to see it.
