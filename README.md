Games Done Quick Reviewed Slow
====

For years now, I've been watching the Games Done Quick charity speedrunning marathons. Out of idle boredom, I started doing rankings and reviews of each run. Then I started posting them to certain forums I'm on. And then people started asking me for more reviews.

After a few years of that, I figured it was about time I actually make a site to archive them all.

So that's what this is!

I have reviews for almost every run from when this started, with AGDQ2019, through the most recent marathon, SGDQ2024. I prioritize watching new marathons as they happen, and then completing runs I missed seeing live, but have also been slowly working through past events, with SGDQ2018 almost completed. The goal is eventually to finish every single mainline GDQ, and I guess if I ever accomplish that, I can think about reviews for GDQx or ESA or other such events.

While I don't accept submissions of reviews, I am more than happy to accept help with the site itself, or with collecting and correcting all the metadata, like records, runner/couch names, and other details. And if you would like to use this site as the basis for your own review collection, open an issue to nag me to set a proper open-source license for it. I've only not bothered because this seems like a pretty narrow use case.
