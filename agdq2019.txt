He did as well as could be expected, but the run is so incredibly glitchy that I don't think anyone can explain it and do it at the same time.

Review: I could tell that this is a very tricky game to speedrun, but it's not a fun speedrun to watch. There's no sense of speed - there's very little time difference between "casual run that takes no deaths" and a speedrun, and this run wasn't even deathless.

Review: Puzzle game runs in general are hit-or-miss - either an ungodly display of skill, or a tedious memorization run, or, like this one, basically a fast Let's Play. The game isn't complex enough for commentary to fill a half-hour, the skill on display wasn't remarkable enough to hold attention alone, and the couch commentary was threadbare.

Review: A more solid run than the two-star rating might imply, but I can't justify giving it another star on either fun or skill. The main draw here is the glitches that make the run possible - there is quite clearly some crazy nonsense going on. Sadly, nobody on the stage was able to actually explain it any better than "by doing this doors go the wrong way and quitting in this game is just a weird door and now we've skipped most of the game".

Review: A really solid run of a great game. Glitches are more about frequent, skips of fairly small sections, or constantly-used speed tech, rather than outright game-breaking, and the commentary was among the best of AGDQ19.

Review: Severely hampered in the fun department by both technical difficulties, and a reasonable need for quiet. Run invalidated, too many deaths forced a switch from "all zones in a row" to "one zone at a time". Can't really fault the runner for failing, this category is impossible, but it probably shouldn't have been run.

Review: Run unable to finish - runner screwed up some quicksaves, basically softlocked halfway through the run, and had no safety saves prepared. I feel kind of bad giving this run a low ranking but it's true. Semanari was incredibly nervous and gave awkward, rambling, disjointed commentary, and messed up more than just the one big mistake. And with no couch for backup, it just wasn't a good run to watch.

Review: Uh, editor here from 2021. So in 2019, I wrote that this was an excellent battle - complex, but easy to follow, and always exciting. But, in the years between now and then, one of the runners was accused of, and admitted to, sexual harassment, and was basically exiled from the speedrunning community, as he should be. I have elected to keep this run in the archives as a testament to the skills and effort of everyone else involved.
Original Review: Surprisingly easy to follow for such a complex battle, although a bit confusing due to contradictory rules explanations. The post-match interview is also worth a watch.

Review: This is a very love-it-or-hate-it run. There's just so much that can't be skipped in this game - long cutscenes, barely any content skips, random encounters that can't be avoided. So 90% of the run is basically a Let's Play. But, that last 10% is some blistering fast menuing and very controlled battles. On the gripping hand, it's a nine-hour-plus run - so long that three runners traded off throughout the run. If you like long JRPG runs, this was a good one. If you hate them, this won't change your mind.
