Review: The speedrun really focuses on the movement mechanics, mostly on abusing them to bypass obstacles entirely. The commentary was remarkably dry for a Nintendo title, but informative.

Review: Well, I liked this one better than most Crash runs I've seen. It's mostly a game of mastering some tricky unintended movement mechanics, but there's not much variety to it, and it doesn't look that much faster than a casual run. Add in a lot of simple, near-autoscroller levels, and it's just a hard run to recommend for series outsiders.

Review: A very chill run. Commentary was informative, but also very subdued and quiet. There's a ton of very small skips and sequence breaks, interspersed with some well-executed vanilla gameplay and a few empty sections that never dragged on too long.

Review: A pretty clean execution of a pretty dull speed game. So much of the runtime was taken up by timed segments that it never felt like the runner's skill was actually making him any faster. Maybe it hits different if you're familiar with the game and its difficult controls, but I wasn't seeing it.

Review: Many runs have had to tackle the problem of long, unskippable cutscenes. Some make up for it with ultra-precise routing of every battle that can be explained - this one, most battles are improvised. Some make up for it with story and lore explanations - this one didn't really bother. Some make up for it with couch shenanigans, and... well, they tried. Chalk this one up to another victim of the online format, maybe.

Review: It's fairly typical RPG speedrun stuff. Glitch to get the best weapon early, glitch to max out your stats, glitch through some doors to bypass a lot of content, and then just slam through everything else. But doing that in a Fable run, with a Fable community on the couch, somehow highlights the absurdity of it all.

Review: Three hours of gamers absolutely *crushing* a run packed with dangerous tricks, commentated by another experienced Mario runner and the inestimable SpikeVegeta. This would have been a highlight even if one runner *hadn't* gotten on an absolutely insane pace. About the only critique I can make is that it wasn't easy to follow who was leading, due to frequent route divergences and the game rarely displaying progress totals.

Review: This run had a lot of tricks, from simple death abuses to some pretty complex technical exploits. The commentary was a bit vague on how a lot of it actually worked but the long chains of inputs kind of speak for themselves, most of the time.

Review: A nice, shorter RE run than usual. It's still mostly dodging around enemies while bouncing between required items, practically glitchless, but the boss fights are tightly planned (and impressively improvised when derailed).

Review: This is apparently the new mega-popular Kid-Friendly Horror game, now that FNAF has declined. The speedrun is pretty basic (a few skips over almost all the content, and then basic walking to each objective) and the commentary offered little of interest, to either newcomers or series fans alike.

Review: Seeded runs are normally all about precise execution, with no randomness... this one was *still* incredibly random, with the time swing of 50% entirely due to not getting needed item spawns, with no good way to compensate. Even setting that aside, the run started off with two minutes of dead time and had no real precision or speed tech besides the route.

Review: This run gets extremely technical, but the commentary tried to keep it simple. I'm not sure whether it worked, but then again, I'm one of those that likes extremely technical exploit explanations. It's basically a bunch of gathering requirements, then executing a credits warp after the first boss. If that sounds fun to you, this is probably worth a watch.

Review: This just wasn't that great of a speed game? It's pretty new so it wasn't that unexpected to be pretty rough and unpolished, but this was a letdown even so. If you want an hour of seeing a cute cat, this will do it, but they didn't even have much fun with that part, instead trying to play it off as a serious speed game.

Review: Bingo matches are always a bit hard to follow, especially for games you're not familiar with. Even the commentators fell behind at some points... but it had some nice, frantic, madcap energy nonetheless. Even a bit of a one-sided match didn't make it less enjoyable.
