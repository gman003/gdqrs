Review: The speedrun really focuses on the movement mechanics, mostly on abusing them to bypass obstacles entirely. The commentary was remarkably dry for a Nintendo title, but informative.

Review: Well, I liked this one better than most Crash runs I've seen. It's mostly a game of mastering some tricky unintended movement mechanics, but there's not much variety to it, and it doesn't look that much faster than a casual run. Add in a lot of simple, near-autoscroller levels, and it's just a hard run to recommend for series outsiders.

Review: I can tell what they were *trying* to do with this run - do that mix of story explanation and trick explanation that's worked wonderfully for runs like Yakuza. The game certainly has enough Plot for that. But with how many sequence breaks this run has, and how little time there was for primers, it rang pretty hollow, and the runner's constant self-deprecation made the mistakes more prominent than the successes.

Review: A very lethargic run. Combat was mostly just ignoring enemies, or spamming them down - occasionally care would be needed to run up a combo or to quickly beat a boss, but it was a relatively uneventful run, with commentary that clearly had not had enough coffee yet. Decent filler, but still filler.

Review: A pretty neat speedrun, considering how niche the game is. It's a mix of proper combat levels and some OoB clips, decent variety. I kind of wish they'd gone more into the lore, either explaining it or making fun of it, because that was where the commentary seemed to rise above the average, but I'm happy enough with what we got.

Review: A pretty clean execution of a pretty dull speed game. So much of the runtime was taken up by timed segments that it never felt like the runner's skill was actually making him any faster. Maybe it hits different if you're familiar with the game and its difficult controls, but I wasn't seeing it.

Review: Many runs have had to tackle the problem of long, unskippable cutscenes. Some make up for it with ultra-precise routing of every battle that can be explained - this one, most battles are improvised. Some make up for it with story and lore explanations - this one didn't really bother. Some make up for it with couch shenanigans, and... well, they tried. Chalk this one up to another victim of the online format, maybe.

Review: It's fairly typical RPG speedrun stuff. Glitch to get the best weapon early, glitch to max out your stats, glitch through some doors to bypass a lot of content, and then just slam through everything else. But doing that in a Fable run, with a Fable community on the couch, somehow highlights the absurdity of it all.

Review: A good run, but the race element was a complete flop. When one runner gets stuck in a reset cycle trying to make an RNG manip, right at the start, that tends to reduce it to two parallel playthroughs more than a race. But setting that aside, it's a fun run - manips, clips, clean movement and some tricky boss fights.

This would have been a highlight even if one runner *hadn't* gotten on an absolutely insane pace. About the only critique I can make is that it wasn't easy to follow who was leading, due to frequent route divergences and the game rarely displaying progress totals.

Review: Seeded runs are normally all about precise execution, with no randomness... this one was *still* incredibly random, with the time swing of 50% entirely due to not getting needed item spawns, with no good way to compensate. Even setting that aside, the run started off with two minutes of dead time and had no real precision or speed tech besides the route.

Review: This run gets extremely technical, but the commentary tried to keep it simple. I'm not sure whether it worked, but then again, I'm one of those that likes extremely technical exploit explanations. It's basically a bunch of gathering requirements, then executing a credits warp after the first boss. If that sounds fun to you, this is probably worth a watch.

Review: Big co-op runs like this tend to be about efficient division of labor, and that's more or less exactly what we get. There's some "bunch of friends goofing off together" energy but it *is* pretty tight gameplay, feels more at home than some other big multiplayer runs. A lot of the tech is just working around game bugs, though, which isn't the most interesting.

Review: After so many Celeste runs, it's cool to see something new, that still retains that core Celeste experience. This isn't like a kaizo hack, it seems to be about the same difficulty as the base game, but it adds new mechanics that spice things up, and Comet crushes it the same way Celeste speedrunners always do.

Review: A short joke physics game, but this run fell flat. Wasting time to do prop comedy doesn't make for a good speedrun, but the runner's limited English skills really ruined the joke delivery.

Review: It's a fairly new game, so the speed tech isn't too polished. And it focuses almost entirely on the dungeon-crawl side, if you were a fan of village-sim gameplay. But it's a good game to joke around about, and while not the most hilarious run of the marathon, it was solidly entertaining.

Review: Seeing such a silly category, for one of the most tryhard speedrunning games out there, makes for an interesting experience. For the most part, you can barely tell they're doing double driver - in a few places, they even use it to their advantage, one player idling to make the controls less sensitive. On the easy White tracks, it was sometimes hard to see just how ridiculously well they were playing. But be sure to stick around for the Black tracks showcase, those were kind of nuts.

Review: I may just be too unfamiliar with MMOs to have appreciated this but... it seemed extremely bland. The main strats were just kiting and avoiding enemy triggers. Maybe if there had been more commentary into the details of the build, or if the enemies had more complex mechanics, but it felt like half an hour of "walk backwards while shooting enemy".

Review: Where past Stepmania showcases have focused on creative mods, this one was pure skill - and dimo delivered. I couldn't even parse the charts as fast as he was dancing them. The first bonus - going in blind with sight-reads - was even more impressive. The second bonus - going up to a chart that has only barely been cleared by humans - was perhaps less so, simply because I have too little knowledge to see what makes it harder than the rest. But it lives up to the tradition of rhythm game showcases, being one of the highlights of the whole marathon.

Review: What fool decided to leave this runner to do his own commentary? The gameplay was fine but he clearly struggled to explain what he was doing, or otherwise say anything that might engage interest. With no couch, this turned into an hour of Melo reading donations and urging people to meet the next incentive. This either needed a good commentator to run support, or to be an early-hours filler run.

Review: Not what I expected from a Pokemon speedrun. There were very few Pokemon battles, and even fewer that needed to be won. Instead, it was more like a collectathon - catch X of this species, hit Y of this species with rocks or food, see Z of this species use this move - with a few boss battles won by dodgerolling through attacks and pelting them with food. There was some skill needed for on-the-fly routing, to adapt to the RNG, but even that barely got talked about. Instead, this was an early-onset late-night-madness run, two and a half hours of bad puns, running gags, and runners playfully shitting on each other. Which yes, can be quite enjoyable, and was a big part of past Pokemon runs, but here it never quite reached the heights it once had. The Arceus battle showcase afterward had some interesting gameplay, but the glitch exhibition was actually a big letdown, nothing too flash and tedious to pull off.
