Review: The only problem with speedrunning this game is that you miss out on all the great writing. Lots of busted platforming, a few skips that cut out like 90% of the game, and some good couch banter.

Review: This game has absolutely brilliant ILs - blindingly fast, impressively twitchy while also requiring precision - but a full-game run? It got tiresome and repetitive less than halfway through. They can't really go into enough depth on explanations while the run is ongoing, but that means the commentary was a long string of near-identical tricks. And there were significant problems with stream hitching from 1davidj, which is a problem in a game where things can move this quickly. A good run to watch until you get bored of it, not something you need to sit through in its entirety.

Review: One of the best races of the Covid era. Close throughout, never had the leader more than one mistake from falling behind, often trading places just off execution. Commentary was fast-paced but not as detailed as I'd have liked, had to go to the YT comments to understand one of the basic tricks.

Review: There's just not enough to this game. A few abilities are so clearly stronger than the others that it gets very samey, and there's only a few actual glitches. Maybe the execution is tricky, but it didn't manage to look like it, to someone who's played the game but briefly. Not a bad run but nothing special.

Review: A game with far too many autoscrollers to be a great speed game. The levels that had actual gameplay were great, lots of interesting tricks, but that seemed like a minority of the run. Couch and runner tried their best to keep it interesting but couldn't. Invalidated by tech issues.

Review: Yet another ridiculously difficult rhythm game. But it's more obscure than Guitar Hero, at least over here, and unlike PIU it isn't obvious how difficult it is. With better camera and presentation, I feel it could have impressed further, but as it is, it's probably one of the weaker exhibition games. And the bitrate and knocking into the camera didn't help. Still cool though.
NM: Might be wrong on release year, couldn't find anything official. The 2013 figure came from a blog reviewing it.

Review: Look. It's a meme game. The main reason for this run was the cutscenes, and BlueMetal did a great job selecting the good ones while not dragging things on too much. The gameplay had some tricks but too much was just running around blowing things up... which sounds cool but was actually kinda tedious.

Review: A bit of a start-stop sort of run. There were bursts of interesting RNG manips, cool jumps, outright glitching, but also long periods of downtime that couldn't quite be filled. And it ended with a sudden credits warp, which felt anticlimactic.

Review: A run that spends a lot of time in the doldrums. Long loading screens, made worse by some mechanics that, if RNG is unfavorable, require you to enter and immediately exit a level. And even during actual gameplay, much of it is simply running through surprisingly empty levels, with not too much interesting tech involved. It feels like an MGS1 run, but worse in every meaningful way. Invalidated by not actually getting Tsuchinoko rank, due to a few deaths.

Review: Look, gamers are nerds. I don't have particularly high standards for public speaking abilities in these reviews. But if you're bringing someone in to be on your couch, and relying on them to explain tech or glitches, it would be nice if they could make it through a sentence without multiple pauses or restarts. I'm a die-hard Pikmin player and I've actually tried to speedrun the first game, and even I got confused by some of the explanations because of poor delivery.

Review: It's a stealth game, but at Easy and with speed strats, it doesn't even look like one. It's mostly clipping out of bounds or hopping around levels, including some very odd "find the level logic flowchart and just trigger the end" tricks. Fun, but it did get repetitive.

Review: A good speedrun, but with almost none of the accompaniment that makes a GDQ performance good. Story explanation? He can't even name all the characters. Tech explanations? Barely present, other than stating the obvious. No glitches. No really flashy tricks. Not even any good gags. This is like something from a decade ago, a very barebones "guy plays game fast" performance.

Review: This run did one thing, and did it well - played an old run-and-gun platformer with precision and skill. The commentary was capable but not very interesting, there were almost no glitches, the route is almost entirely fixed, and they did far less with the absurdity of the game than they could have. But if you want to see an 8-bit platformer get wrecked, this will do that for you.

Review: The runner choked a few times, but the level of skill needed for this run is just kind of insane. I think messing up a few times actually did a better job showing just how tough some of those tricks are. Informative commentary, if a bit dull, and not too long of a run.

Review: This had no right to be as good as it was. Brilliant commentary, very polished gameplay for a current-year game... I'm even surprised how good the game looks, because "tie-in game for an anime based on a book based on a D&D homebrew campaign" isn't typically a recipe for quality, but this was actually properly good.

Review: I was hype for this run, but it was a huge letdown. It was beset by technical issues - stream hitches and an absolutely awful microphone - but even if it hadn't been, it wouldn't have made for a great run. Sierra gave a lot of commentary but very little of it was good commentary. It was disordered, halting, mostly just confusing. And while the knowledge of the inner workings of the game was impressive, it didn't even require much in way of execution. Great work routing, no work needed for running.

Review: Perhaps if you've played this game, you could better appreciate the skill involved. But to an outsider, it kind of just looks like spamming the same busted move over and over. It's effectively glitchless, and the route is pretty linear, so this run comes down purely to execution. Which it did well, but still hard to hold your interest for a full hour.

Review: The good type of chill late-night run. Bloodthunder does a great job on self-commentary, I think it was half an hour in before he even had a breather for donations. The games aren't too super technical, but there's a lot of tricks and he explained them well, while also describing the story without spoiling too much. The run itself is super glitchy - if there's a wall, he's going to clip through it - but entertainingly so.

Review: I don't think a single piece of tech got explained during the entire run - Vynn focused purely on the story, making this more of a brief Let's Play than a speedrun. I could understand if it was obvious how one was going fast, but... unless you've played this game, you're going to have no idea whether this run was tediously slow or blazingly fast. Vynn did an excellent job at running a game that really is not suited for speed marathons.

Review: I suppose I'd class this game as a rhythm platformer. Unlike pure rhythm games, it is an actual speedrun, and some of the tricks in use are crazy. But it does still suffer from some autoscroller sections, and the run is rather unpolished - even when setting a world record, there were many deaths.

Review: This run would have been fine if it were thirty minutes. Two hours is a bit much, for a lightly-glitched run like HZD - there's a lot of tech but almost none of it is interesting, just memorizing enemy locations and routing exactly how to best defeat them. And somehow, despite being on the highest difficulty, NG+ weapons are OP even up to the final boss and you can run through half the stealth sections. It could maybe have worked as a backdrop to couch shenanigans (Elkjaer ran solo) or in-depth discussion of the broader game (Elkjaer spent enough time saying "I can't cover the game's lore in two hours" to probably have covered the game's lore)

Review: We've seen several RE7 runs before. A race is a good way to shake it up, but it doesn't completely fix the problems with it as a speed game. Expect a lot of down time and cutscenes. As a race, it started strong - they were almost in sync for the first half-hour - but once one fell behind by a minute, from a small mistake, the positions never changed again.

Review: The game might be Resident Evil In Space, but the run certainly isn't. The main movement mechanic is a glitch, there's frequent out-of-bounds, a few entire chapters are skipped almost entirely. The run is not quite as polished as many other games, but it seems like it's evolving quickly. This might be a new classic speed game.

Review: A bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lot of OoB, messing with level loading, and unintended platforming. On the other hand, a lot of the run was just "run past enemies, completely ignoring them", and that gets real old when you're pushing two hours. The thing that tipped me over into liking it was the couch - mixing "former recordholder" with "guy who used to casual this game" made for some great interaction.

Review: The run is basically a knows-what-they're-doing casual run, but that's probably just due to how new it is. And it makes up for it by being entertainingly weird, without being broken. Good reaction couch, and a surprisingly informative set of donations.

Review: See this game? This is what surrealism *actually* is. Like most of silly block, the run is more about the game than the run, but a) this is a good silly game, and b) the run is actually pretty decent too. It's levels dense with objectives, so lots of tight routing, and just enough glitches to feel like a speedrun instead of a fast Let's Play.

Review: I have rarely seen a run that so completely misses its own point. The category exists solely to show off the hilariously bad cutscenes? Go ahead and talk over them. Mix the audio so the music overrides everything else. Give self-commentary that's as muffled, meandering, and stilted as the game itself.

Review: Keeping with the theme, this is only occasionally a racing game speedrun. Mostly, it's a wrecking game speedrun - tricking the AI, somehow, into destroying itself and handing you the win. On the rare occasion racing is actually needed, a glitch with drifting makes it almost trivial. Being AI manips, they're not super consistent, but it's funny enough for this hybrid Racing/Silly block.
Critique: Okay, since I know the runner will actually be reading this, a constructive critique as well as a review are in order. Everyone other than Martinz, you can stop reading, this won't be relevant to you. The biggest problem I had was just that you and Chazoshtare kept talking over each other. I don't know how much lag you had on the voice chat, but it was definitely disruptive. You repeated your explanations enough that I eventually got it all, but it took longer than needed. This has been a problem for a lot of runs since they started going online-only, but others have figured out how to minimize it - I'd suggest asking around, see how they've been doing it. Secondly, I'd suggest working on your delivery - there were a lot of funny things going on, and you were telling some jokes that could have been funny, but your timing was off and your delivery lacked confidence. You probably just need practice here. You were also let down quite a bit by Chaz's commentary - he didn't seem to add much that was interesting, and he stumbled over his words quite often (which strangely, he didn't do in his self-commentated IWBTKISA run). I think this was more him than you talking about it, but I also question the choice to focus on explaining the story - yes, it's a bonkers story with a lot of things to laugh at, but I think the story explanations overshadowed the actual speedrun explanations. Every other complaint I have is more about the game than your run, it's not like you can change the fact that most of the run is AI manips to force them to wreck, which did start to feel repetitive towards the end.

Review: I am disappointed that the MMMMMMMMMM meme didn't seem to last past Racing Game Block. I'm sure if this had been a live event, we'd have gotten the crowd doing it for the next three days. As for the actual run... it's a ridiculous gimmick of a game that makes it absolutely hilarious to watch. There's no speed tech beyond "play game well", and I'm not entirely sure Chaz *did*, but the game is so unlike everything else that I can't really tell.
Critique: And this run is why I pin most of the blame for the bad commentary for Paris Chase on Chaz, not Martinz - because when Chaz wasn't able to talk, things went incredibly well. As far as commentary went, I have nothing bad to say, it did everything it needed to and did it well - it explained everything worth explaining, told every joke that was worth telling, but never got in the way. I'm sure you still have room to improve but fuck if I can tell you how. Should I ever somehow put on a run at GDQ, I'd be glad to have you on my couch.

Review: This is a game that really shouldn't exist, not on the GBA. The controls are bad enough that races are won by pingponging off walls, and the Moby Dick is overpowered enough that Cosmyk could lose nearly a minute to dicking around with a DDR pad and still come in first. Which is to say, it's a pretty fun speedrun to watch.

Pursky does an okay job explaining it all, but he does throw over to donations quite a bit more than most runners do, which is a sign of how much of the run is the same trick being repeated in new places.
