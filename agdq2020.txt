Review: I'll be honest, I'm not super into R&C games. Like all the other runs of this game, it was pretty heavily glitched, execution was decent, but it just didn't hold my attention that well. A perfectly fine run - but we're clearly out of the kickoff highlights.

Review: Stop me if you've heard this one before - a race between the reigning people's champ, the rising star using some unconventional strats, and the underdog going for all the risky strats to try to keep up with the rock-solid execution of his elders. It's SMB3, we've all seen it before, but it just doesn't get old.

Review: A run that treats the game more like a software puzzle to be solved than a game. The "least-broken" Zelda is starting to fall to the bughunters and routers - this run is half the length of the last GDQ run, and one-thirteenth the length of my casual playthrough. There's constant, heavy abuse of the "Back in Time" glitch, plus some rather insane strats to shave mere seconds off a multi-hour run. And it caps off with a blindfolded boss fight, just like last time. Gymnast does a great job explaining the intricate, sometimes inscrutable route, although seemingly at the cost of his own consistency.

Review: Not a very good speedgame, IMO. Most of the tricks are just "jump to the death plane that respawns you farther into the level", and you have so many lives that it's not even constrained. Apparently the game is quite hard to control well, but you'd only know that from playing, and this is a pretty obscure game.

Review: A very, very glitchy JRPG run. It's kind of hard to follow the finer details, but you can at least know when wonky things are happening by the garbage on the screen, and they don't do a *bad* job explaining it. I'm just the kind of guy who likes absurdly detailed exploit descriptions. And changing off between the two runners - even doing a "co-op" boss fight - shakes it up over the length of the run.

Review: Maybe the game with the most frame-perfect tricks per minute? Walls are *actually* just a suggestion, gravity is a recommendation, and the canon is even worse. Focus's execution is excellent, but it's such a bad game that every trick is hilarious. Only problems: about a quarter of the run is loading screens, and Focus's commentary sometimes stumbled, and often couldn't keep up. Still an excellent run.
NM: Used record for "No Credits Warp", which does allow MSG but with limits, seems like the correct category given the estimate.

Review: Fallout games are notoriously buggy. This run exploits every single one of them to beat five games in not too much longer than two hours. Tomato keeps up breakneck commentary, complete with props, while nailing most of the tricks. A few tough glitches in 3 and 4 were punishing, but overall he did fine. It wasn't the best showcase of speedrunner skill, but it was one of the most fun runs in GDQ history.

Review: The actual speedrun is kind of middling at best, because the game's kind of middling as a speed game, but MAN does adef make up for it with shenanigans. If you come here to see a game done quick, you're going to be mildly disappointed - if you come here to see a parody of every Game Done Quick run, you'll be cracking up the whole time.

By no means is this a bad run... it just doesn't bring anything new to the table.

This run could have used a better couch, but Gunner did a fine job. He really showed off his knowledge of the game, and only lost time to RNG.

Review: Well that was a fast drop. Badger did really good commentary... but the run got fucked up. I'm not familiar enough with the game to tell whether he just got screwed by RNG, or if he misplayed, or what, but the run fell apart halfway through. It wasn't even an entertaining trainwreck at that point. Even using safety saves and cheats, he wasn't able to finish the run - when they mercy-killed it, he was going onto the wiki to look up server commands. I'd love to see him on the couch next time, his energy was amazing, but either this runner or (more likely) this game are just not marathon-ready.

Review: I had high hopes for this race. The first three Zelda games, back to back? This should have been amazing. So pardon my disappointment when I say that the race was merely pretty good. It was just too uncompetitive - one team had controller issues and had to kill their Zelda 1 run in the final dungeon, putting them far behind; another team suffered the worst time loss possible in Zelda 2 and still stayed in second place. The entire last ninety minutes, the only doubt in the outcome was "maybe someone will softlock and not be able to finish". There was just no way anyone was going to make up that much time just off execution. And without that, it became less a race, and more three simultaneous speedruns.

Review: Nine hours is just too long, and this game just has too little in the way of skips. I don't know what the actual stats are, but it felt like it was about half unskippable cutscenes. With a heroic effort, they might have been able to keep things interesting - and they did, in fact, make a few parts worth watching. But they didn't sustain it - by the end, not even the runners seemed to be enjoying themselves. Watch the highlights - the blindfolded menuing, the karaoke bit, the plot explanation, and the superboss battle - and you'll have seen 99% of what's worth watching.

Review: The best "normal" category for RE4 - NG instead of NG+ avoids some blatantly OP weapons, Pro avoids the boring "die deliberately to lower the hidden difficulty" strats. Mike had a pretty solid run, good commentary. But the offhand mentions of "No Merchant" category strats makes me want to see one of those, if such a run is safe enough for a marathon.

Review: They spent most of the run talking about the Ultimate Difficulty incentive. Which would have made the run a lot more interesting, since the combat was trivial with full upgrades. And the game itself had some fairly long forced waits. This game, or at least this category, just isn't a great speed game. Couch banter kept things a bit interesting but there's only so many Spider-Man jokes to crack.

Review: I usually love Halfcoordinated's runs, but this one? Not a fan. EDF isn't a series known for being particularly hard, and constantly wasting time on shouts and gestures came across more as forced memery than flexing on how well he can play the game. I came away from it thinking I could probably do a one-handed *blind* playthrough of the game. I probably can't, but HC made the game look easy in a bad way.

Review: A fiendishly technical run - the entire category only exists because of a glitch, and requires several more to complete. I don't think there was a single battle performed as intended. Fully explaining this run would take far longer than the run itself, so it's a bit lacking there, but I was still able to mostly follow it.

Review: A very novel run for GDQ viewers. It's the first MMOFPS to be run and the first run I've seen with six active runners. The commentary may as well have been in Abkhazian - so much Destiny lingo and lore. It was like staring into an alternate universe - had it gone on too much longer, it might have been a problem, but half an hour was a good length for this game. And the runners popped off when they got their loot, I don't really understand what they were so happy for but joy is infectious, so it was a good way to end the run.

Review: Was this Newt's first GDQ? They seemed pretty nervous, often losing track of what they were saying. Great speedrun (although a bit of a free WR, since the dev just patched in cutscene skips), but could definitely have benefitted from better commentary.

Review: This arguably should have been in Awful Block, because it's a pretty terrible game. But sadly, it's also a very boring speedrun, because there's one trick that gets abused over and over, and it's not even that interesting. The route for half the game is "fly in a straight line to the end trigger". This run was proof, if you still needed it, that not all bad broken games make good speedruns. Lizstar and couch made a valiant effort to make it fun anyways, but it's not enough.

Good commentary but the game itself doesn't shake much up, it was starting to drag after just twenty minutes.

Review: A skill exhibition, not a speedrun... but what an exhibition it was! The sheer ability on display is unbelievable - this was a block that ended with the hardest song in Guitar Hero III, but it looked like a tutorial song compared to everything else we'd seen.

Review: "Hey, you know those randomizers? Imagine that, except you also have Twitch chat trying to fuck you over as hard as possible." If that description doesn't sell you on it, I'm not sure this is the VOD for you.

Review: The latest game from From Software put up a pretty good fight against the runner. As such a recent game, it's not too broken, and it's difficult enough that Aggy actually couldn't complete the category due to too many deaths. Probably a load of fun if you've played the game, but as a soulsborn outsider, I wasn't too impressed.

Review: The game the entire marathon had been memeing over. It was okay. Pretty silly game, so the run was inherently silly, but Tas didn't go too nuts with it.

Review: Look, if you've seen a custom Mario blind race, you know what kind of treat you're in for. These are some of the best gamers in the world, honing skills for literal decades, in one of the most dramatic displays of prowess possible. There's nothing else I can say about it.

Review: This is big news for the TAS community, being able to console-verify Switch runs. It's not that great a show, though. You're better off reading the Ars Technica article that went up about the same time.

Review: It's a fairly new game, so the run is pretty rudimentary, but TGH is a beast and executes it nearly perfectly. And we're in the final-hours energy now, making for a pretty entertaining speedrun (even if it wasn't all that fast).

Review: A preposterously skilled Super Metroid runner, takes on an impossibly-difficult romhack. Not the smoothest run, because even tiny mistakes often end in death, but a fitting end to the marathon.
