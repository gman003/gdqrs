Review: A nice start to the marathon, with a collectathon. There's a good amount of using small glitches to get things done quickly and efficiently, before using a major skip to end things before it stretches out too long. A bit heavy on cutscenes, especially with several stacked together, but not too bad about it.

Review: Another collectathon, this one *almost* glitchless. Just a lot of really efficient routing to get all the myriad collectables needed, with not too much downtime. Including a "casual" on the couch helped prompt a lot more explanation than runs of this sort normally get, which I appreciated.

Review: A particularly clean Kirby run, but I can't say it does much for series outsiders. The heavy reliance on a single screen-clearing super move to end boss fights made it pretty uninteresting, and the game has such a low skill floor that seeing it played far above that doesn't look that impressive.

Review: It's an RTS speedrun, so lots of APS, lots of fiddly micro-management of units. It's a CovertMuffin run, so lots of nervous laughter and panicked un-fucking-up, when not motormouthing through explanations of everything. The couch didn't even get introduced until the credits rolled.

Review: With gymnast86 behind the controller, you know some *shenanigans* are going to happen. Physics is abused, bounds are ignored, time goes wibbly-wobbly for a bit, and only one dungeon is completed in anything remotely like as Nintended. An excess of cutscenes and some rather dry commentary make this run not for everyone, but if you want to see a game get pretty busted, you're in for a treat.

Review: The any% run turns this game into essentially an out-of-bounds first-person platformer. Combat is absolutely an afterthought - a few mandatory bosses getting insta-killed by a BFG glitch. But some technical hiccups and a lack of variety made this less fun than it could have been.

Review: This run had a nice sense of progression to it. Early on, it's glitchless, execution-focused, lots of efficient movement and fast aiming, collecting just enough money to afford rocket launchers to one-shot bosses. But as it progresses, glitches start making their way in, first just some animation speedups, but later on several out-of-bounds to skip major sections.

Review: An infamously hard game, but not that interesting a game to watch for two hours. There's a ton of downtime, a ton of backtracking, a ton of cheese strats, and a surprisingly unpolished speedrun. If you've played the game yourself, it's probably a treat, but from the outside, it doesn't impress.

Review: For a run with a costume, this was a very deadpan run. The jokes seemed to fall flat in front of the 5AM crowd. Behind that was a perfectly adequate but unremarkable run. This was filler that aspired to be more than filler and failed, but was still perfectly fine filler.

Review: If I had to describe it in one word, it would be "awkward". The runner was awkward, the couch was awkward, even the host was awkward. If you look past that, you find a run that's simple, repetitive, sparsely commentated, and not very polished.

Review: Not much downtime in this run - even during cutscenes, the couch was busy explaining the next level's tricks and tech. More fluid movement than most Mega Man games, and a bit of RNG manipulation to make things consistent.

Review: This game feels like a tie-in action-platformer. It just has those vibes, even though it seems to be original. Absolutely busted, this is a run of "do some prereqs, clip out of bounds, walk to the end, repeat". A good one if you like that, but half an hour of it was getting close to my appetite for it.

Review: The entire run is RNG-manipped. The entire thing. All of it. Like half the run requires perfect movement, and even with tile-based movement, that's not easy. And most of it is memorized! The only lookups vaxherd seemed to need was to figure out where he was in the RNG seed. This is a very technical run, and some very costly mistakes led to some repetition, but it's still an impressive technical achievement.

Review: This is very clearly a run in transition. Most of the tech that will be used throughout later Skyward Sword runs is here, it's just not implemented as thoroughly or widely. You'll get tricks to skip some fairly large parts of the run, but then see long chunks played almost casually, while they bemoan that there's tricks that *almost* let them skip it. And that leaves the run with a lot of dead time, more than is needed to explain the tech, and long stretches of donation-reading that kill any momentum they'd built up. I remember being pretty impressed by it at the time, but if you're watching it now, there's better versions of this run, by the same runner.

Review: Too full of autoscrollers and cycle-based bosses to be a great speedrun, and too random and inconsistent to be a great race. It's not bad by any stretch, but probably more for the deep action gamers than for a general audience.

Review: A short, twitchy sort of shooter, but the verticality of the levels opens up some pretty neat shortcuts, and it's got a lightning pace.

Review: A shooter from the Doom era, lots of quicksaving to pull off ridiculous grenade hops or zoom past enemies without needing to shoot them. The humor of the game perhaps has not aged well, but the energy of the runner makes up for it.

Review: A modern roguelike take on the 6DOF shooter. Some unfortunate level RNG gave a lot of downtime, and neither the movement nor combat is particularly impressive. Still, a rare enough genre to be worth checking out.

Review: There's a lot of cool stuff in this run - neat glitches, clever movement, bold strats. Unfortunately, it's very hard to see most of it, due to the game being played almost entirely in the dark.

Review: This was kind of just a run. Not much in the way of glitches, not even that much tech. The route is so scripted that there's no room for improvement over a typical walkthrough. There's some good commentary on display, and very clean execution, but I'm sad to say, this run just didn't impress.

Review: One of the more obscure Zelda titles, this isn't super optimized but ZMaster is clearly pushing it forward. The commentators are regularly amazed he's even attempting certain tricks, let alone consistently getting them. If this were shorter, it would be an easy recommendation, but two hours of it is a bit much. At least it's almost entirely gameplay - very few cutscenes, not much dead time of any sort.

Review: A little low-energy for a primetime run like this, but still enjoyable. A few mistakes couldn't mar the impressive precision on display, and kept up for a full hour.

Review: A tricky run from a great runner. TMR wasn't quite as high-energy as some of his more legendary runs, and the run gets a bit one-note, but it's still a ton of fun.
