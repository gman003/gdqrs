Review: A nice start to the marathon, with a collectathon. There's a good amount of using small glitches to get things done quickly and efficiently, before using a major skip to end things before it stretches out too long. A bit heavy on cutscenes, especially with several stacked together, but not too bad about it.

Review: Another collectathon, this one *almost* glitchless. Just a lot of really efficient routing to get all the myriad collectables needed, with not too much downtime. Including a "casual" on the couch helped prompt a lot more explanation than runs of this sort normally get, which I appreciated.

Review: A particularly clean Kirby run, but I can't say it does much for series outsiders. The heavy reliance on a single screen-clearing super move to end boss fights made it pretty uninteresting, and the game has such a low skill floor that seeing it played far above that doesn't look that impressive.

Review: It's an RTS speedrun, so lots of APS, lots of fiddly micro-management of units. It's a CovertMuffin run, so lots of nervous laughter and panicked un-fucking-up, when not motormouthing through explanations of everything. The couch didn't even get introduced until the credits rolled.

Review: With gymnast86 behind the controller, you know some *shenanigans* are going to happen. Physics is abused, bounds are ignored, time goes wibbly-wobbly for a bit, and only one dungeon is completed in anything remotely like as Nintended. An excess of cutscenes and some rather dry commentary make this run not for everyone, but if you want to see a game get pretty busted, you're in for a treat.

Review: The any% run turns this game into essentially an out-of-bounds first-person platformer. Combat is absolutely an afterthought - a few mandatory bosses getting insta-killed by a BFG glitch. But some technical hiccups and a lack of variety made this less fun than it could have been.

Review: This run had a nice sense of progression to it. Early on, it's glitchless, execution-focused, lots of efficient movement and fast aiming, collecting just enough money to afford rocket launchers to one-shot bosses. But as it progresses, glitches start making their way in, first just some animation speedups, but later on several out-of-bounds to skip major sections.

Review: An infamously hard game, but not that interesting a game to watch for two hours. There's a ton of downtime, a ton of backtracking, a ton of cheese strats, and a surprisingly unpolished speedrun. If you've played the game yourself, it's probably a treat, but from the outside, it doesn't impress.

Review: For a run with a costume, this was a very deadpan run. The jokes seemed to fall flat in front of the 5AM crowd. Behind that was a perfectly adequate but unremarkable run. This was filler that aspired to be more than filler and failed, but was still perfectly fine filler.

Review: If I had to describe it in one word, it would be "awkward". The runner was awkward, the couch was awkward, even the host was awkward. If you look past that, you find a run that's simple, repetitive, sparsely commentated, and not very polished.

Review: Not much downtime in this run - even during cutscenes, the couch was busy explaining the next level's tricks and tech. More fluid movement than most Mega Man games, and a bit of RNG manipulation to make things consistent.

Review: This game feels like a tie-in action-platformer. It just has those vibes, even though it seems to be original. Absolutely busted, this is a run of "do some prereqs, clip out of bounds, walk to the end, repeat". A good one if you like that, but half an hour of it was getting close to my appetite for it.

Review: The entire run is RNG-manipped. The entire thing. All of it. Like half the run requires perfect movement, and even with tile-based movement, that's not easy. And most of it is memorized! The only lookups vaxherd seemed to need was to figure out where he was in the RNG seed. This is a very technical run, and some very costly mistakes led to some repetition, but it's still an impressive technical achievement.

Review: This is very clearly a run in transition. Most of the tech that will be used throughout later Skyward Sword runs is here, it's just not implemented as thoroughly or widely. You'll get tricks to skip some fairly large parts of the run, but then see long chunks played almost casually, while they bemoan that there's tricks that *almost* let them skip it. And that leaves the run with a lot of dead time, more than is needed to explain the tech, and long stretches of donation-reading that kill any momentum they'd built up. I remember being pretty impressed by it at the time, but if you're watching it now, there's better versions of this run, by the same runner.

Review: Too full of autoscrollers and cycle-based bosses to be a great speedrun, and too random and inconsistent to be a great race. It's not bad by any stretch, but probably more for the deep action gamers than for a general audience.

Review: A shooter from the Doom era, lots of quicksaving to pull off ridiculous grenade hops or zoom past enemies without needing to shoot them. The humor of the game perhaps has not aged well, but the energy of the runner makes up for it.

Review: One of the more obscure Zelda titles, this isn't super optimized but ZMaster is clearly pushing it forward. The commentators are regularly amazed he's even attempting certain tricks, let alone consistently getting them. If this were shorter, it would be an easy recommendation, but two hours of it is a bit much. At least it's almost entirely gameplay - very few cutscenes, not much dead time of any sort.

Review: A rather neat first-person platformer. This is now known as the No Major Glitches category - so plenty of stuff that cuts corners or skips sections of a level, but nothing that bypasses actually playing the game.

Review: The frequency with which Heinki threw things over to donation-reading says a lot about how little interesting stuff happens in this run. Yeah, there's some wonky out-of-bounds skips, and some clever strats to run through levels safely without stopping. But by the half-hour mark, there's nothing new added. I don't even remember the couch ever saying a word.

Review: Just an hour of really good Super Mario World. It's not a kaizo hack, so the skill is more about consistently performing risky strats on regular levels - but outside one *really* risky strat, rezy nailed them all. Some fun couch banter, too.

Review: This run just wasn't all that interesting. There's no intricate routing to blitz through sidequests, no massive skips. The out-of-bounds are easy but short, the glitches to keep damage high are simple and only briefly amusing. Some genuinely great banter keeps this run from sinking entirely, but it still doesn't make this a must-watch.

Review: It's somewhat amazing that a game this busted, has such a rigidly linear speedrun. You just can't skip much without breaking the script. But with a game this busted, just being able to play-game-good is impressive, and summarizing the insane story gets more than a few laughs. If this had been a shorter run, it would be an easy recommendation, but an hour is perhaps a bit much to ask.

Review: A very artsy game, with an unexpected level of dev attention to the speedrun, but still a humdrum watch. I love dev commentary for the deeper insight - someone saying "we wanted to make the speedrun better, so we let you skip cutscenes, mostly" is too superficial for that. And I never really grokked any of the gameplay.

Review: The gameplay here isn't the most natural to follow - it's sort of Tetris-like, in that it relies on decision-making being made far faster than casual players or outsiders can even grok. But it's smooth, and comes with robust explanations for the details. It will take more work than most runs, but you'll get something novel for it.

Review: Bmups, as a genre, don't have speed strats that are all that much faster than ordinary skilled play. The best ones I've seen, cranked the difficulty up to levels where the speed comes from *not* relying on special safe strats, just running full-tilt at the worst the game can throw at you. By this metric, this run is excellent - charging straight into the cannon's mouth, and somehow crushing it. It's still not the most diverse speedrun, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Review: A harder hack of an already pretty-hard game, but it's not as obvious at first glance that it *is* harder. And the speedrun is more about damage-boosting through enemies, than anything interesting. This is a perfectly fine run, especially for Mega Man fans who want something more, but nothing special.

Review: It's a Mega Man run. Being a post-NES installment of the series cuts down on a lot of tedious friction, adds more movement options, but at its heart, this is a Mega Man run. Great for people who like Mega Man runs, maybe a bit dull for people who aren't super into Mega Man runs.

Review: Even top-notch commentary and three karaoke breaks, isn't enough to make this run all that engaging. Yes, it's hard, and that's impressive, but there just isn't enough variety in the speedrun to make it impressive for three hours. But if you're already into hard Kingdom Hearts runs, have some familiarity with the game and the challenge, this probably hits the spot. Like I said, there's great commentary and execution.
NM: Used WR for "Level 1", is proud mode separate?

Review: This was a very good run, until it wasn't. A little rough at the start, with several tries needed to nail the very first trick of the game, but it was all clear sailing from there. Even the then-novel barrier skip was first-try. But it hit a very rough point after this, which sours the whole experience. I recommend watching up to 1h13m (video timer), then skipping to 1h24m.
