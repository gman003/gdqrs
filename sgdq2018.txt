Review: A nice start to the marathon, with a collectathon. There's a good amount of using small glitches to get things done quickly and efficiently, before using a major skip to end things before it stretches out too long. A bit heavy on cutscenes, especially with several stacked together, but not too bad about it.

Review: Another collectathon, this one *almost* glitchless. Just a lot of really efficient routing to get all the myriad collectables needed, with not too much downtime. Including a "casual" on the couch helped prompt a lot more explanation than runs of this sort normally get, which I appreciated.

Review: And now for a metroidvania with several huge skips, to the point that it's basically just collecting everything needed to defeat the final boss battle. An entertaining run, but nothing spectacular.

Review: A particularly clean Kirby run, but I can't say it does much for series outsiders. The heavy reliance on a single screen-clearing super move to end boss fights made it pretty uninteresting, and the game has such a low skill floor that seeing it played far above that doesn't look that impressive.

Review: A tight and interesting race. Getting all the upgrade mechanics right off the bat makes this a solid hour of fluid and intense movement, and the racers were pretty much always within the margin of route divergence.

Review: It's an RTS speedrun, so lots of APS, lots of fiddly micro-management of units. It's a CovertMuffin run, so lots of nervous laughter and panicked un-fucking-up, when not motormouthing through explanations of everything. The couch didn't even get introduced until the credits rolled.

Review: With gymnast86 behind the controller, you know some *shenanigans* are going to happen. Physics is abused, bounds are ignored, time goes wibbly-wobbly for a bit, and only one dungeon is completed in anything remotely like as Nintended. An excess of cutscenes and some rather dry commentary make this run not for everyone, but if you want to see a game get pretty busted, you're in for a treat.

Review: The any% run turns this game into essentially an out-of-bounds first-person platformer. Combat is absolutely an afterthought - a few mandatory bosses getting insta-killed by a BFG glitch. But some technical hiccups and a lack of variety made this less fun than it could have been.

Review: This run had a nice sense of progression to it. Early on, it's glitchless, execution-focused, lots of efficient movement and fast aiming, collecting just enough money to afford rocket launchers to one-shot bosses. But as it progresses, glitches start making their way in, first just some animation speedups, but later on several out-of-bounds to skip major sections.

Review: An infamously hard game, but not that interesting a game to watch for two hours. There's a ton of downtime, a ton of backtracking, a ton of cheese strats, and a surprisingly unpolished speedrun. If you've played the game yourself, it's probably a treat, but from the outside, it doesn't impress.

Review: A comprehensively routed game, every jump and hit planned out, even attempting to keep a known RNG going for the first several stages. A marathon run gets off that, leading to some fun improv.

Review: A classic game, but a lackluster speedrun. Being only two hits from death makes a lot of strategies impossible, and dboosts very limited. And the second loop is too similar to the first to be engaging, making this twenty-minute run drag a lot more than most.

Review: For a run with a costume, this was a very deadpan run. The jokes seemed to fall flat in front of the 5AM crowd. Behind that was a perfectly adequate but unremarkable run. This was filler that aspired to be more than filler and failed, but was still perfectly fine filler.

Review: If I had to describe it in one word, it would be "awkward". The runner was awkward, the couch was awkward, even the host was awkward. If you look past that, you find a run that's simple, repetitive, sparsely commentated, and not very polished.

Review: The runner's excellent vibes couldn't make up for the sheer lack of stuff important enough to talk about.

When Boyo did commentate, it was pretty good, but there just wasn't anything going on that called for it.

Review: A much more technical game than I expected. Damage boosts, sure. Some unintended routing, of course. But building up hyperspeed to get through a wall before it loads? Didn't see that one coming. So there's some nice execution behind the goofy jokes.
