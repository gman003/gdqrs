Review: A nice start to the marathon, with a collectathon. There's a good amount of using small glitches to get things done quickly and efficiently, before using a major skip to end things before it stretches out too long. A bit heavy on cutscenes, especially with several stacked together, but not too bad about it.

Review: Another collectathon, this one *almost* glitchless. Just a lot of really efficient routing to get all the myriad collectables needed, with not too much downtime. Including a "casual" on the couch helped prompt a lot more explanation than runs of this sort normally get, which I appreciated.

Review: A particularly clean Kirby run, but I can't say it does much for series outsiders. The heavy reliance on a single screen-clearing super move to end boss fights made it pretty uninteresting, and the game has such a low skill floor that seeing it played far above that doesn't look that impressive.

Review: It's an RTS speedrun, so lots of APS, lots of fiddly micro-management of units. It's a CovertMuffin run, so lots of nervous laughter and panicked un-fucking-up, when not motormouthing through explanations of everything. The couch didn't even get introduced until the credits rolled.

Review: With gymnast86 behind the controller, you know some *shenanigans* are going to happen. Physics is abused, bounds are ignored, time goes wibbly-wobbly for a bit, and only one dungeon is completed in anything remotely like as Nintended. An excess of cutscenes and some rather dry commentary make this run not for everyone, but if you want to see a game get pretty busted, you're in for a treat.

Review: The any% run turns this game into essentially an out-of-bounds first-person platformer. Combat is absolutely an afterthought - a few mandatory bosses getting insta-killed by a BFG glitch. But some technical hiccups and a lack of variety made this less fun than it could have been.

Review: This run had a nice sense of progression to it. Early on, it's glitchless, execution-focused, lots of efficient movement and fast aiming, collecting just enough money to afford rocket launchers to one-shot bosses. But as it progresses, glitches start making their way in, first just some animation speedups, but later on several out-of-bounds to skip major sections.

Review: An infamously hard game, but not that interesting a game to watch for two hours. There's a ton of downtime, a ton of backtracking, a ton of cheese strats, and a surprisingly unpolished speedrun. If you've played the game yourself, it's probably a treat, but from the outside, it doesn't impress.

Review: For a run with a costume, this was a very deadpan run. The jokes seemed to fall flat in front of the 5AM crowd. Behind that was a perfectly adequate but unremarkable run. This was filler that aspired to be more than filler and failed, but was still perfectly fine filler.

Review: If I had to describe it in one word, it would be "awkward". The runner was awkward, the couch was awkward, even the host was awkward. If you look past that, you find a run that's simple, repetitive, sparsely commentated, and not very polished.

Review: Not much downtime in this run - even during cutscenes, the couch was busy explaining the next level's tricks and tech. More fluid movement than most Mega Man games, and a bit of RNG manipulation to make things consistent.

Review: A cozy sort of run. The game is too early in the 3D era to have really fluid movement, so it's mostly about glitches and exploiting developer naivete. There's not too much to talk about, but the runner kept things from being boring.

Review: This felt like a ninety-minute donation read while someone played Resident Evil in the background. So little of note happened in this run that I have nothing to comment on. Even the interaction with donation comments, charming at first, became clearly rote tedium by the end of it. If I ever watch this run again, it will be as a sleep aid.

Review: An unconventional runner, doing a mostly-conventional run. Not your typical GDQ vibes, but I liked them. Lots of delving into how they developed the speedrun, starting from "this sucked casually, I want to punish this game for it", up to the GDQ run.

Review: This is the kind of game where they clap every time they beat a level without triggering a softlock. Expect SM64-style platforming, but with bargain-bin indie levels of quality. Which makes for a neat speedrun, naturally, even if it's not particularly remarkable.

Review: This game feels like a tie-in action-platformer. It just has those vibes, even though it seems to be original. Absolutely busted, this is a run of "do some prereqs, clip out of bounds, walk to the end, repeat". A good one if you like that, but half an hour of it was getting close to my appetite for it.

Review: The entire run is RNG-manipped. The entire thing. All of it. Like half the run requires perfect movement, and even with tile-based movement, that's not easy. And most of it is memorized! The only lookups vaxherd seemed to need was to figure out where he was in the RNG seed. This is a very technical run, and some very costly mistakes led to some repetition, but it's still an impressive technical achievement.

Review: A run with a lot of rough edges, but also a lot of love put into it. There's very few actual tricks, and those there are are executed very inconsistently. I believe a cause was later uncovered, but that shows just how early in the game's life this run was. Yet Shasta manages to put on a charming show.

Review: A somewhat arbitrary run, cutting out the tedious item-get jingles of 100%, and adding in a few locations not seen in any other categories. The couch focused more on banter than on commentary, but Super Metroid is a well-known speed game at this point, most watchers don't exactly need shinesparks explained to them.
