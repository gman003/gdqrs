Review: A nice start to the marathon, with a collectathon. There's a good amount of using small glitches to get things done quickly and efficiently, before using a major skip to end things before it stretches out too long. A bit heavy on cutscenes, especially with several stacked together, but not too bad about it.

Review: Another collectathon, this one *almost* glitchless. Just a lot of really efficient routing to get all the myriad collectables needed, with not too much downtime. Including a "casual" on the couch helped prompt a lot more explanation than runs of this sort normally get, which I appreciated.

Review: A particularly clean Kirby run, but I can't say it does much for series outsiders. The heavy reliance on a single screen-clearing super move to end boss fights made it pretty uninteresting, and the game has such a low skill floor that seeing it played far above that doesn't look that impressive.

Review: It's an RTS speedrun, so lots of APS, lots of fiddly micro-management of units. It's a CovertMuffin run, so lots of nervous laughter and panicked un-fucking-up, when not motormouthing through explanations of everything. The couch didn't even get introduced until the credits rolled.

Review: With gymnast86 behind the controller, you know some *shenanigans* are going to happen. Physics is abused, bounds are ignored, time goes wibbly-wobbly for a bit, and only one dungeon is completed in anything remotely like as Nintended. An excess of cutscenes and some rather dry commentary make this run not for everyone, but if you want to see a game get pretty busted, you're in for a treat.

Review: The any% run turns this game into essentially an out-of-bounds first-person platformer. Combat is absolutely an afterthought - a few mandatory bosses getting insta-killed by a BFG glitch. But some technical hiccups and a lack of variety made this less fun than it could have been.

Review: This run had a nice sense of progression to it. Early on, it's glitchless, execution-focused, lots of efficient movement and fast aiming, collecting just enough money to afford rocket launchers to one-shot bosses. But as it progresses, glitches start making their way in, first just some animation speedups, but later on several out-of-bounds to skip major sections.

Review: An infamously hard game, but not that interesting a game to watch for two hours. There's a ton of downtime, a ton of backtracking, a ton of cheese strats, and a surprisingly unpolished speedrun. If you've played the game yourself, it's probably a treat, but from the outside, it doesn't impress.

Review: For a run with a costume, this was a very deadpan run. The jokes seemed to fall flat in front of the 5AM crowd. Behind that was a perfectly adequate but unremarkable run. This was filler that aspired to be more than filler and failed, but was still perfectly fine filler.

Review: If I had to describe it in one word, it would be "awkward". The runner was awkward, the couch was awkward, even the host was awkward. If you look past that, you find a run that's simple, repetitive, sparsely commentated, and not very polished.

Review: A solid run of the series revival, by one of the most charismatic runners GDQ has seen? Hell. Yes. Even the mistakes were just another chance for *The* Blacktastic to show off his skills.

Review: Not much downtime in this run - even during cutscenes, the couch was busy explaining the next level's tricks and tech. More fluid movement than most Mega Man games, and a bit of RNG manipulation to make things consistent.

Review: An extremely challenging run, both due to the bosses, and just the intense platforming this game requires at this speed.

Review: A run heavy on out-of-bounds, from small shortcuts to major skips. The combat's a bit retry-heavy and it might have gone on too long, but it was consistently engaging.
