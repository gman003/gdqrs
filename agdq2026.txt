Review: It's a precision platformer with a strong unique gimmick - I'm glad the couch made the Celeste comparison themselves, because it definitely gives many of those vibes, without just being a Celeste clone. I could see this becoming a big speed game - the route will be crazy after a few years of polishing - but it's already plenty fun to watch.

Review: I'm sure someone better-versed in Soulslikes could explain exactly what makes this one distinct from all the others. Alas, I am a scrub who barely made it through the Elden Ring tutorial, so all I can say is that this was fun to watch. Plenty of good commentary, clean execution, a few big skips, I'm not sure what else you could ask for.

Review: A pretty unusual Pokemon run, since Z-A shifts up the gameplay substantially. But you'll find a lot of the familiar elements. Detailed strats for every battle, some on-the-fly adaptation, and filling time with story primers. Rank F cuts short of the full plot, but I think not doing the full six-hour run was probably a good call. The bonus battle after was worth a watch.

Review: It's not the first rhythm game showcase, nor the first fitness game showcase. But the combination is still pretty cool to see. The run was good, but commentary could have used more about the actual game, and I wish the audio mix could have had the music up louder. Mostly, though, this is exactly what it says on the tin.

Review: When I sat down to watch this, I noticed the run time was over 15 minutes longer than the estimate. How did that happen, I wondered? Was it through constantly bleeding time in little places everywhere, or one big mistake? Turns out - both. There's a lot of clips and sequence breaks in this game, and many of them were third-try, or fifth-try, or give-up-and-do-it-casual. And then there was an extended out-of-bounds sequence that was failed repeatedly, which alone cost half an hour. Were it done first-try, it still would not have made for a riveting watch, it's going far from any loaded rooms so it's just staring at the skybox, with only particles to tell which way they're moving. This is a run that would have struggled to keep me awake even if everything had gone well, but whether nerves, a new setup, or just bad luck, things did not go well. There's still some highlights, especially for Prime fans, but you'll want the fast-forward button.

Did they forget how to do a decent offline run, after a few years of being back to mostly in-person?

Review: The commentators kept comparing it to Paper Mario, but I saw a lot more 2D Zelda in this formula. Dungeons with key items to solve puzzles and bosses, overworld exploration - and also, a lot of the speed tech. Clinking off walls to jump over bottomless pits, glitches with screen transitions. If you enjoy LttP or LADX runs, especially if you're looking for something besides the same old, this will be a good one for you.

Review: It's a ninety-second speedrun, and half of that is the runner voicing out the cutscene. It's perfectly fine, just making me question my policy about which bonus runs get their own review. But this is an actual, leaderboarded category. Definitely stick around for it if you watched the main run, but I can't see anyone wanting to watch this separately.

Review: I had no idea what to expect, when I saw this on the schedule. If you want to go in similarly blind - stop reading now and go watch. If you want a synopsis, though, it's a troll mod for Halo. Not a full kaizo experience, more silly and goofy than properly brutal. This run was done on a slightly tweaked version, which the runner hadn't seen before playing, and that makes it just so much better.

Review: I think putting this in Science Block was a mistake. They didn't have anything to add on commentary, and mostly just seemed to be there to be confused by the story explanations that ended up the majority of commentary. As far as the run - pretty clean, and neat to see how the remake changed things, but it lacks the polish of the game that's been perfected over decades. Metal Gear fans will enjoy, but if you just want to see what an MGS3 run is like, there's been better.

Review: Now here's a run that properly used the scientist on the couch. I'm adding a full bonus star just for the really good psychology talk that accompanied the run. That alone will probably make me rewatch it. As for the run itself - solidly competent. There's enough prop flies and other tricks to not feel like a Let's Play, but nothing spectacular. The game's just too cinematic to really let a speedrun shine.

Review: This is a hard one, because by most objective metrics, this was a bad run. Like they straight up did not finish the intended race, because things just went so completely off the rails. Probably half the run is spent trying to get the run to continue. But they were clearly aiming for a comedy, and I *did* laugh, loudly and often. So it succeeded at what it tried to be. If you want a twelve-car pileup of a run, this is worth a watch.

Review: An extremely realistic rally-racing sim, played in VR with full gear. The difficulty is obvious - if you drive a car, you can tell how insane it is to drive like this. You don't need to know the game, you just need to know rally - which is why the commentary focuses on actual motorsport, down to an actual co-driver on the couch. It just all comes together perfectly.

Review: This is a weird one, because the mod is aimed to rebalance things and make it more fair competitively, but the run is of the singleplayer which wasn't even a consideration. So sometimes it makes things weirdly hard, mostly it makes things easier. It's simple enough to follow along, had some flashy tricks and good commentary, but I'm not sure what the main appeal was even meant to be.

Review: Banning RNG manipulation leaves you at the mercy of the dice gods, and wow, they were cruel today. It ended up using some safety saves just to avoid too many retries. Despite that, it was a pretty good run, showing off the skill in trying to finish a run with a bad set of stats, figuring out on the fly how to adapt. The couch wasn't completely unhinged, like some Pokemon runs have been, they were mostly informative, but they kept the mood light enough to not be a snoozefest either. The ACE showcase afterward was some real fun, too.

Review: After having DK64Randomizer.com hyped up for years, I was a little underwhelmed? Like this wasn't bad, it just wasn't the incredible awesomeness I was expecting. I think just too much of the run took place inside the players' heads, silently strategizing and routing. Maybe I'd have been able to intuit that better, if I knew the base game better? Or perhaps if I merely liked it better. Either way, this was fun, especially for fans of runner suffering.

Review: Now this is an actual Awful Game. I wouldn't be surprised to learn a tech-savvy child made it, because it's that sort of injokey, crude mess. Unfortunately, the run itself was also a bit of a mess, missing a lot of tricks and dying often enough to scrap the run. The lack of checkpoints or any sort of saves made it perhaps too punishing for a marathon run. But if you're watching Awful Block for the awful and not for anything resembling a speedrun, watch away.

Review: Like later Splatoon games, this is a combination of high-skill-ceiling movement with not super challenging shooting. What this adds to the mix is a trick to skip about 60% of the game. The race was close but didn't see many changes of position after that skip, which ended up being decisive. This might be a good Splatoon run to start with, if you're curious, since it's so much shorter.

Review: Oddly, I think this run shares more with Pokemon than Final Fantasy. It's all about building up a single character to be able to sweep enemy formations, with a minimum of grinding. Mostly, it's getting additional attacks via the jobs system, and a tight money route to afford single-use damage sources. (If you've seen other Octopath runs, yes, Hired Help makes many appearances.) I found the "with these hands" meme overdone by the end, but other than that, a good run to chill to.

Review: This committed the cardinal sin of rhythm-game GDQ showcases: it just went on too long. Half an hour in, every song seemed identical, I couldn't see any change in difficulty or change in where that difficulty came from. The commentators mostly did a play-by-play, narrating what was going on; between that they tried to explain what significance these songs had to maimai players emotionally, or what role they played in the story or meta-story (while not giving any context to put it in). And all the while, they were hammering home that there was an optional bonus run of the *real* hardest songs, affirming that we really were sitting still on the difficulty curve. I suggest watching this until it starts to feel repetitive, then watch the bonus runs to break things up, then if you're still enjoying it, come back to finish this off.

Review: "We have Nier: Automata at home" is definitely accurate, both for the game and the run. So if you like those, you'll probably enjoy this. The speedrun is mostly about out-of-bounds shenanigans to skip as much as possible, which is a lot and well-executed, but leaves an unfortunate amount of cutscenes. That time gets filled in by synopsizing the game's plot, so definitely spoiler territory, but good if you weren't planning to play this game anyway.

Review: We get a lot of kaizo, but it's almost all SMW. SMB2 kaizo is new ground. The game's skill ceiling isn't nearly as high, so this isn't the jaw-dropping displays of skill seen in traditional kaizo, but it's still hard, and still cool to see.

Review: There's enough glitches to break this game pretty severely. It still takes some good old-fashioned skill to weave through mobs of enemies, and more to pull off some of the tight out-of-bounds. But later bosses get melted by some tricks, and doing the whole run wearing full armor is just excellent comedy.

Review: What. What? How is a game this new, *this* good? The speedrun is fucking relentless, it doesn't let up for a second, there's tricks everywhere letting them skip everything. The couch can barely keep up. Absolutely exhilirating - my only regret is that it did spoil what would've been a cool twist, but that's on me for not playing it yet.

Review: This was cooler in theory than it was in practice. Watching someone execute SRM setups is never really entertaining, the only fun bit is the crazy result. Stretching that over a long period of trying and failing quickly reaches the point of tedium. It's an easy recommend now that you're watching the VOD, and can fast-forward through the most repetitive bits.

Review: I was expecting maintaining the RNG manipulation to be the focus of the run, but that went remarkably unremarked on. Instead we get two-ish hours of gushing about the game, goofing off, and some routing behind-the-scenes tidbits.

Review: The run itself is nothing too remarkable. Some tricks to maintain or redirect momentum, one out-of-bounds, one sequence break, and some routing optimization. Some might enjoy the borderline-hyperventilating commentary, but I found it a bit grating. Still, if that's not a problem for you, and you like lackadaisical indie platformers, you're likely to enjoy this one.

Review: A massive relay of 70+ people, playing through SM64. Most of them are *not* SM64 runners, just runners of other games at the event who volunteered to learn one star, and it kind of shows. They're trying to do speed strats, mostly, but they're very sloppy and inconsistent. Which I actually enjoyed - it shows just how much practice it takes to be *good* at a speedrun, not just able to pull off a flashy trick one time in ten. Plus, all the ways different runners put their own flair on things.

Review: It's ACE. Of course it goes like this - some obligatory vanilla stuff to start off, then some weird stuff with moving boxes around and getting into pixel-perfect positions, then suddenly the credits are rolling. It's slow and the explanations are extremely dry - as a boring computer nerd, this was 100% my jam, but I have to admit, this is not a riviteing watch.

Review: This run actually reminded me more of Monster Hunter showcases than Elden Ring. The team coordinating abilities and cooldowns while ganging up on a single giant foe, the low cost of dying, all felt more like that than any soulslikes. Add in roguelike buildcrafting on the fly, and you get a run that's kind of hard to understand, but I expect you'll enjoy if you know the game well enough to follow along.

Review: This is more of a challenge run than a speedrun - donors forcing adef to play through the game with the worst pokemon imagineable. There were a few concessions made to make sure the run was completeable, and it did lean a bit on spamming X-items. But the banter was excellent, and seeing a master pick apart each battle like a puzzle was peak.
