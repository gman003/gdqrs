Review: A great start to the marathon. The gameplay isn't too demanding (by speedrun standards) but Rad executes it perfectly, while keeping up some of the most charming commentary I've heard. The only reason not to watch this run, is if you still haven't beaten the game yourself.

Review: Clearing Expert is hard. Clearing Expert Plus is hard. Doing both of those without using a continue, just to unlock the Master levels? I was on the edge of my seat for basically the entire run.

Review: One of the weirder entries in the Sonic series - a metroidvania, on Sega's ill-fated handheld? For a "glitchless" run, there sure are a lot of exploits, but the game controls terribly so that's probably for the best. Very fun commentary, pointing out all the early-installment weirdness and general WTFery, and explaining the typically-overwrought story.

Review: A game with so many ways to clip through walls, that they truly do seem like mere suggestions. Yet the game itself is so bloated with content that, if you require players to collect enough of just a single item that the game tries to require, it turns into a two-hour slog. Fun for DK fans and collectathon afficionados, but a bit long for the rest of us.

Review: A marathon run that beats second place on the leaderboards is always impressive. This is a game packed with out-of-bounds and sequence breaks, but 100% negates most of the shenanigans that normally leads to. Instead it turns into a sprawling Traveling Salesman problem, and two hours of near-flawless movement.

Review: One of those runs that's incredibly broken, but in a very opaque way. Some of the clips are easy enough to follow, but the stuff with menu states seems to be a mystery even to runners. The bonus run afterward is skippable for anyone but die-hard FFXV players - just a slog of waiting for the openings and guzzling revives.

Review: A snappier JRPG speedrun than many we've seen in the past, even Octopath I. Grinding is brief and cutscenes are skipped, but there's still a ton of work needed to get to the game's superboss. And then beat him blindfolded.

Review: Sort of a weird mix of other Pokemon speedruns. The bulk of it is typical of glitchless - phenomenal recall of every stat and battle, plus maintaining an overworld RNG manipulation for way longer than should be possible. But then it abruptly smacks into a glitch-straight-to-the-end run. I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but if that sounds fun to you, go right ahead.

Review: On many measures, this wasn't a great speedrun. Technical issues invalidated it right off the bat. The strats are almost always "run on old patch and use busted weapons" or "pile bunker while they stand still for cutscene". It has neither the difficulty nor the depth of a Dark Souls run (in case you expected this to be a soulslike). But if you spent an entire day slogging it out with the autonomous PCA craft, BALTEUS, seeing its pulse armor broken and massive damage inflicted to one-cycle it is still pretty satisfying. And bringing in actual scientists to talk about the plausibility of it, use it as a springboard for current advances, is fascinating.

Review: Even on legendary, these players are so good that they make the combat trivial. I think they only ever died to each other (in banter-filled coop shenanigans), or themselves (as part of speed strats). There's a good mix of out-of-bounds broken-ness and more as-intended speedrunning. And of course, moments after mentioning they were on WR pace, one of the computers died.

Review: Far too little time to properly explain a roguelike like this, even with a softlock and an entire second run happening. And it's zoomed out enough to not be visually apparent what's going on. Those who've sunk a hundred hours into Risk of Rain will probably be amazed, but it's not a great run for outsiders.

Review: Such a new game, so clearly far from its potential, but it's interesting how quickly it's been broken like this. And four decades of cumulative 2D Mario experience has laid a strong foundation, making a much more polished run than other games this recent.

Review: A run that's always riding on the edge of disaster, but never quite tips over it. RE4 enemies, OG or remake, are more aggressive than in prior games, so the walk-briskly-past strat isn't nearly as safe. *Mostly* played as-intended, other than that - glitches exist but not often, nor skipping too much content.

Review: It's more RE4 Remake. But it doesn't do anything the main-game run didn't do, and has even less time for the route to be polished.

Review: A tough game to run live, since so many of the skips are so inconsistent. Kaz wasn't 100% on them but got the backups and at least went for everything that anyone goes for in All Cups runs, and he had a great crew doing commentary for him.

Review: The proto-kaizo game gets speedrun, and it did not let them beat it easily. Lots of scrambling to recover powerups, but that kept the race close.

Review: The skills tested by a speedrun are often quite different from those tested by a normal playthrough, but this takes it to an extreme. It's just clipping. Some obscure sequence of frame-perfect inputs that will zip you out of bounds, which if done correctly can despawn bosses and beat the game. There's some intellectual joy in seeing a game beaten this quickly, but done this way, it's surprisingly boring.

Review: A longer soulslike run, but IMO the better one. A wider array of tricks to do shorter skips, and some actual combat (and requisite building of character). And for such a new game, with no existing series to build off, it was impressively polished.

Review: The smoothest commentary of all time returns, this time with a game that *isn't* four hours long. I don't know why he even has a couch - Froob probably knows these games better than some of the people who worked on them, and keeps up a buttery stream of plot synopses and gameplay explanations that is second to none.

Review: Like its predecessor, this game's Any% is "clear the tutorial then charge directly at final boss", each taking up about half the run. But now, through the power of downpatching, there's all kinds of item duplication glitches and some out-of-bounds movement - in enough different ways to require gymnat86's trademark tech primers.

Review: In most games, speed strats are somewhat unconventional. So in a game that deliberately supports many unconventional solutions, the speed strats get really, really weird. It's great. Spoiler warnings, though.

Review: The good parts: fast menuing, no long cutscenes, no long grinds, and some interesting JRPG mechanics to abuse. The bad parts: some brutal RNG, and no good explanation of a near-runkiller that cost a massive amount of time. Mistakes happen, but even after rewatching a bit, I'm not sure what even happened, just that it lead to many repeats of a simple random encounter, trying to survive it. Explaining those disruptions from the plan is far more interesting than tossing over to donations while trying to quietly get things back on track. Still not a bad run, if you like JRPGs, but a disappointing one.
