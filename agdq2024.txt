Review: A great start to the marathon. The gameplay isn't too demanding (by speedrun standards) but Rad executes it perfectly, while keeping up some of the most charming commentary I've heard. The only reason not to watch this run, is if you still haven't beaten the game yourself.

Review: Clearing Expert is hard. Clearing Expert Plus is hard. Doing both of those without using a continue, just to unlock the Master levels? I was on the edge of my seat for basically the entire run.

Review: A successor to BFBB and its remake, this has much better movement than you'd expect from a licensed platformer. Still pretty busted though - lots of level skips, some using very simple tricks.

Review: One of the weirder entries in the Sonic series - a metroidvania, on Sega's ill-fated handheld? For a "glitchless" run, there sure are a lot of exploits, but the game controls terribly so that's probably for the best. Very fun commentary, pointing out all the early-installment weirdness and general WTFery, and explaining the typically-overwrought story.

Review: A game with so many ways to clip through walls, that they truly do seem like mere suggestions. Yet the game itself is so bloated with content that, if you require players to collect enough of just a single item that the game tries to require, it turns into a two-hour slog. Fun for DK fans and collectathon afficionados, but a bit long for the rest of us.

Review: A much more chill run than I was expecting. Not much tech, just clean execution of a simple route while adapting to the random bumper cars. Very laid-back vibes that worked weirdly well for this game.

Review: Another very easy run to watch, 80% of it is just movement and blasting demons. But there's just enough extra stuff to keep things interesting. Great couch work, too.

Review: More the fault of the game than anything the runner or commentators did wrong - it's just too long, without enough novelty to keep an outsider interested. A delight for Jet Set fans, I'm sure, but by the halfway mark, I was starting to zone out.

Review: A very busted sort of run - lots of out-of-bounds, animation cancels, even just glitchy movement, whenever it's faster than intended. Very sarcastic humor, too.
