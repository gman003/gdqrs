Review: A great start to the marathon. The gameplay isn't too demanding (by speedrun standards) but Rad executes it perfectly, while keeping up some of the most charming commentary I've heard. The only reason not to watch this run, is if you still haven't beaten the game yourself.

Review: Clearing Expert is hard. Clearing Expert Plus is hard. Doing both of those without using a continue, just to unlock the Master levels? I was on the edge of my seat for basically the entire run.

Review: One of the weirder entries in the Sonic series - a metroidvania, on Sega's ill-fated handheld? For a "glitchless" run, there sure are a lot of exploits, but the game controls terribly so that's probably for the best. Very fun commentary, pointing out all the early-installment weirdness and general WTFery, and explaining the typically-overwrought story.

Review: A game with so many ways to clip through walls, that they truly do seem like mere suggestions. Yet the game itself is so bloated with content that, if you require players to collect enough of just a single item that the game tries to require, it turns into a two-hour slog. Fun for DK fans and collectathon afficionados, but a bit long for the rest of us.

Review: A marathon run that beats second place on the leaderboards is always impressive. This is a game packed with out-of-bounds and sequence breaks, but 100% negates most of the shenanigans that normally leads to. Instead it turns into a sprawling Traveling Salesman problem, and two hours of near-flawless movement.

Review: One of those runs that's incredibly broken, but in a very opaque way. Some of the clips are easy enough to follow, but the stuff with menu states seems to be a mystery even to runners. The bonus run afterward is skippable for anyone but die-hard FFXV players - just a slog of waiting for the openings and guzzling revives.

Review: A snappier JRPG speedrun than many we've seen in the past, even Octopath I. Grinding is brief and cutscenes are skipped, but there's still a ton of work needed to get to the game's superboss. And then beat him blindfolded.

Review: An absurdly tight race. The mod takes away *most* of the RNG, but there's still just enough to keep things spicy.

Review: This category is basically a boss rush, and Bobbeigh just *melts* through the bosses. No fancy tech, no intricate setups, he is just Good At Video Game, and it's amazing to watch.
