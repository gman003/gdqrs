Review: A solid start to the marathon. A much more precise run than previous Spyro runs I've seen, and much faster-paced than most collectathon platformers. Couch did a good job explaining things (or at least prompting ChrisLBC to explain things), and had some decent banter too.

Why mod the game soundtrack and then practically mute the game audio? The run was pretty average - good but not great execution, clever routing but no glitches.

Review: Kind of just a rough run all over. The couch was dead, the host had no chemistry with the runner, the donations were just lame puns, the runner was really distracted by trying to re-route to make up for early missteps but didn't even do it verbally so we had no insight into the process. He's done much better runs than this. Guess he just had a really off day.

Review: Fun fact - I once cited this game, in a schoolyard argument, as evidence Nintendo titles are generally less buggy, because the worst glitch I could find in this game was one spot where you could induce a lot of lag. I apparently was absolute garbage at finding glitches, because this game, and this run, are PACKED with them, even compared to the previous run. I think they spent longer out of bounds than in it. And while Claris took a couple tries on some very costly tricks, the banter was top notch.

Review: A peculiar little 2.5D, almost 2.75D shooter. Runner made a good time but was pretty low-energy, and with no couch he had to try to both run and explain all the tricks involved... he focused on the run and so the commentary was pretty weak. He did the best he could, he just really needed a couch.

Review: These Sega game runs are kind of weird to me. I never had a Sega console, and neither did anyone I knew. I've played Sonic games, obviously, but the rest of the Master System, Genesis, Saturn, and Dreamcast library is an alternate universe to me. So the couch spends a lot of time talking about the long and storied Wonder Boy series, that I've never heard of outside of GDQ. Makes me wish I had the time to delve into the Sega-platform series more.
Anyways, the actual run was good. Quality commentary, nice blend of small glitches, routing, and solid execution. No minds will be blown but it's a solid run, especially for night shift.

Review: "This is just as big a disaster as Bonesaw's Jak & Daxter run, but not as funny." Actual quote, but not really true. It was a sleep-deprived wacky-antics run, but nowhere near that level. It was sort of forced, even, Viceroy was *trying* to make it a trainwreck run. But other than nonsensical shoutouts, some deliberate-cringe Fortnite jokes, and a few awful puns, it wasn't all that deranged. Unfortunately, the focus on the sideshow made the actual run kind of bad. Only a few crashes, sure, but lots of really slow driving, and even a few bits where it was sitting at a menu waiting for him to press A, while he was standing up doing a Fortnite dance or something.

Review: I don't really know why this race ended up boring me so badly. The runners were good, the couch was great, it was reasonably competitive... it was just really tedious. I think Crash just doesn't make for a very good speed game to watch. It's clearly fun to run, else there wouldn't be so many people for it, but with such an incredibly linear game, it's just not fun to watch. It is a testament to this crew that they dragged it all the way to two-and-a-bit stars.

Review: This could have been, *should* have been, a great run. It's a very silly game, in the middle of Silly Games Block. But Garbi was just torture to listen to. She stammered constantly, trying to listen to her explanations of anything was nearly impossible - and half her commentary was just "wow I'm doing this badly". Mr_Shasta contributed nothing from the couch. And the run itself was absolutely just "play game good". You can absolutely skip this one.

With a good couch he could make up for that, but that's not what we got.

Review: This run was kind of bad by normal speedrun standards... but it was surprisingly entertaining. The specific category is very RNG-heavy - one rare thing happened first-try, but then we'd spend five minutes grinding through an awful RNG lottery. An emotional roller coaster, to be sure. The couch was great, and there was a lot of shouting from the crowd (which I'm not a fan of but some people clearly like).

Commentary suffered a bit from not being able to keep up with the actual run, but was still overall a great run.

The gameplay is boring, the speed tech is minimal, the commentary was mostly just stating the obvious, and even the runner seemed almost bored by it. It's a category with a single record, for a game with maybe a half-dozen runners on the leaderboard. It's not the worst filler run I've seen, but it's filler.

NM: 2021!GMan here, looking up the WR. It seems like Speedrun.com renamed the category due to new tricks being discovered - I'm pretty sure what used to be any% in 2019 is now Defeat Ganon%, No SRM. If this is wrong, please file a bug and let me know.
