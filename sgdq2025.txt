Review: This is a bit of a weird one. In a game with so many types of collectibles, some are still completely mandatory, have to route in hundreds, many as intended. Others are skipped almost entirely, through a series of absurdly precise glitches. So you get a blend of both worlds.

Review: There's a decent bit of out-of-bounds, but a lot of it's just playing the game efficiently, not needing to explore and scrutinize the levels. Definitely a primitive speedrun, this early in the game's life, but there's some interest to be found in that too.

Review: Every little thing in this game has a strat. Every phase of all fifty-something bosses, and movement between them - and runner and couch were well-equipped to explain every single one. Unfortunately they get rather samey by the end. If you're a die-hard Sekiro fan, you'll love this, but outsiders might not have as much appetite.

Review: The relentless begging to get the incentive met, distracted from the first half of the speedrun. The second half was dominated by redoing all the first levels, but with secrets this time. When there was commentary, it was talking over each other or spouting random jokes. It would have been better to just do the Easy Run and let it stand.

Review: I just really didn't like this run. Talking more about how the game's speedrun is basic hold-right-and-jump, than about the times it's *not*, doesn't give a good impression. And the "couch banter" was mostly cowboy accents and corpsing at their own jokes, which were mostly continuations of a bit from last GDQ (which I didn't even like then!). Late-night madness runs can be enjoyable, but this one wasn't.

Review: Most of the fun is from explaining the bonkers setup for the game, and the blind couch reacts, but there *is* an okay speedrun under it all. Some just-barely-possible unintended platforming, some boss quick kills. The only real dead time is an autoscroller right at the end, and even that's not too long, so it's a great run if you want something fun, but still like, actually a speedrun.

Review: I doubt this is a well-known version of the game, but it's got some charm to it. Lots of clipping out of bounds, skipping large chunks of levels, but the aggressive enemies and limited healing makes it a very risky run. Clean execution and some good commentary, though it did lack a bit for variety.

Review: There was very little discussion of what exactly makes you go fast in this game, and at least from the outside, it didn't seem obvious, or even all that polished. A lot of the commentary was about how RNG can basically just kill you whenever it wants, but I can't say that makes for a very good watch. There was some fun here, if you just want TMNT stuff, but it's an easy skip otherwise.

Review: This was described as a kaizo hack of Spyro 3, but I can't say it felt like it. I didn't hear many differences pointed out between this and the base game, and all the difficulty seemed to lay in a few speedrunner glitches. I expect it stands out more if you've played Spyro 3 yourself, but from the outside, this was pretty lackluster.

Review: Speedruns often shift how the game is played, and few do that more than Talos runners, who turned this slow puzzle game into a platformer. It's all clambering over walls or bringing boxes where they're not supposed to be. Fun, but even this short a run had more "nothing to say here, throw it over for donations" than I liked.

Review: Some runs work through precise execution, others through complex glitches, others through liberal application of speed tech. Here? It's cheese strats. Just different ways to do what the game is asking you to do, in ways the game clearly did not intend you to do. Add in some couch silliness, and it's a pretty fun run.

Review: We've seen this game many times before. How do you make it new again? How about making every enemy and boss, invisible? It's not just random difficulty, it emphasizes the AI manipulation that's the core of the run. And, when things go wrong, how well the runner has internalized the AI, to adapt to it.

Review: It's got all the hallmarks of a busted Castlevania run. Tricks to get late-game stats early? Check. Warping all around the map, melting through mandatory bosses? Check. Some weird memory-manipulation shenanigans? Check. Maybe a bit too technical to dive into fully during the run, but it's at least explained well enough to follow. Invalidated by using a few safety savestates, due to bad drop RNG.

Review: Another run carried hard by a charismatic couch and an enthusiastic audience. It's some out-of-bounds clips and platforming, sprinkled among just running through all the enemies or slugging it out in scripted wave fights. Fast-forwarding all the cutscenes left it with no dead time. But it was the banter that really makes this a run worth watching, despite the vocabulary constraints of a G-rated stream. But since this is my review site and I make the rules, I'll go ahead and say it for them: fuck nazis, whatever name they happen to call themselves this time.

They bypass a lot of it by not getting enough karma, good or bad, to get any of the more specific endings, but they don't even describe what doing that entails. It makes me think I'd have been better off watching a casual LP.

Review: This could really have benefitted from a good couch. The runner struggled a bit to give good commentary while also playing the game. A lot of basic things got missed - I don't think even "it's a Sonic racing fangame" got explicitly stated, although you could have guessed as much. But some of the trick explanations flew over my head, because the fundamentals were skipped over. Still a neat run, and it's clearly tricky to play well, but unfortunately tricky to watch as well.

Review: It's definitely an outlier in the Mario Kart series - sort of like the SNES original, due to similar tech constraints, but with some ideas from later games. It's not quite as finely-polished, nor as loaded with skips, but it's nice and easy to follow, and it had enough going on that I wasn't bored. A full-series run from Johan might be a good late-night hours-filler.

Review: In contrast to all the kaizo romhacks, here's a "standard" one, trying to mimic the difficulty of baseline SMW. We still get some speed tech - shell jumps make an appearance - but it's much more like a vanilla SMW speedrun. Half the commentary was about how good the game looked, all the little details, and that's not a complaint from me.

Which, granted, was pretty funny, but if you were hoping for a focus on the speedrun, you might be disappointed. (That said: wordle speedrun at gdq when?)

Review: Over the years, this run just keeps getting more and more busted. It's all clipping and prop-flying and menu glitches now. Gulch nails most of them, and the few struggles just highlight how finicky and precise some of them are. A little mood whiplash from the last run, going from electric hype to technical virtuosity, but still a fine run.

Review: Bumping the difficulty up to Madhouse was definitely a worthy incentive. Everything feels one small slip-up away from failure, and the couch always has something to talk about - from the big out-of-bounds to more mundane hallway strats. There's a little dead time in the back third but it's a pretty tense, if rarely flashy run.

It doesn't demand all that close attention, so if you're looking for some good background noise or easy watching, look no further, but I'd have liked a bit more depth.

Review: This was unfortunately a bit of a slog to get through. This is much more Awful Block than Silly Block - but even then, it's not a *fun* sort of awful. It starts with a long money grind, then turns into a rat's nest of backtracking. Most of the run was just traversing the same areas over and over, running past enemies, not doing or saying anything interesting. There were a few good jokes but not enough to carry an hour-long run.

Review: A unique setup for a racing game, and with a typically tongue-in-cheek Sega tone. The casual game is pretty much a speedrun already, and the skill ceiling's not quite high enough to make it that interesting - but those ridiculous cutscenes more than make up for it. Certainly one of the silliest games we've seen this block, and Helix did a great job highlighting it.

Review: It's a long run, but it's got a nice arc to it. Starts off almost glitchless, slowly accumulating tools to break the game more and more. It never gets as busted as Twilight or Ocarina, you still see every dungeon, but you see a lot less of the later ones. Not the best introduction to the Zelda series speedruns, but as someone who's seen plenty of the other games, I was glad to see this one given some love.

Review: The king of the couch, moving up into the runner's seat. He doesn't disappoint, but he does play to his strengths - wasting a bit of time here and there, to show off fun parts of the game, or doing some funny banter with the couch. A wise choice - this game seems to have less speed tech than its sequel, it's not bad but it would have been stretched thin covering ninety minutes.

Review: Veering from hilarious insanity into technical speedrunning precision, this is maybe the closest race I've ever seen. They were trading places all the way through Mother Brain, maybe even escape sequence. And this is not an easy category! It was all tiny errors and the RNG of item drops - when you can only carry five super missiles, those play a big role. It's a dry, technical run, with only a bit of teasing between rival runners, but if you want pure speedrunning, it doesn't get much better than this.

It wasn't easy to tell who was in the lead at any point, not knowing the levels, but commentary explained everything else well, and did a decent job telling you which screen to pay attention to. I do recommend focusing on just one, though, don't try to split across them all.

And then we get an absolutely storybook plot, I don't even want to spoil the twists and turns for you.

Review: It's hard to explain exactly why this fell so flat for me. Maybe it was the repetition - the difficulty ramped up, yes, but it was hard to distinguish one song from another. They added some new challenges but mostly just got faster. The commentary gave history behind each song, but to an outsider very little of it mattered. If they'd given us some time to actually listen to the songs, maybe they'd be less of a blur, but maybe not, most sounded like the syncopated, arpeggio-filled mess that rhythm-game music often is, just a few tracks an outsider might recognize. Even the skill showcase stumbled, the last few songs seemed to be beyond the runner's ability (mostly by being absolutely impossible). Maybe I've just seen too many other rhythm-game runs - this was the third of the marathon - or maybe it just doesn't do anything the SGDQ2020 run didn't already do. But end of the day, all I can say is, I didn't enjoy this one much.

Review: It's neat to see an Amiga game, of all things, at a GDQ. But this run was rather monotonous. The biggest speed tech was picking up speed-boosting collectibles we rarely got to see, thanks to constant strafing, and enemies rarely presented even a momentary obstacle. Neat for a bit, but when you start sending things over for donation-reading this often, it's a good sign the game's not deep enough for a GDQ.

Still a little long, considering, but that's more the game's fault.

Review: A very polished run, but not above a little goofing around. A little something for everyone.

Review: It's a parlor trick of a speedrun, some fancy memory manipulation and glitching. Not even anything new, if you watched the main run - the same skip was used there, just going to World 8 instead of the ending. Neat, but just a novelty, and too short to even begin to explain it properly.

Review: A much more subdued TAS than most. It doesn't break the game in any massive ways, just plays it inhumanly well and gets inhumanly lucky. It's actually a nice change of pace.

Review: Celeste runners are just something else. These B-Side, C-Side levels are hard enough casually, but they find ways to make them harder in the name of saving a few frames. An excellent race (if balanced a bit by waiting on the menu for the other to catch up), with one runner going for some bonkers new strats while the other stuck to the reliable ones.

Review: Just a quick follow-on to the main race, but the two very different approaches made it fascinating. If you want a quick preview before committing to an hour-long run, give this a whirl, you'll probably enjoy.

Review: It's a pretty dry run, focused on skill, very technical commentary. But uh. Holy shit. Carpetless? In a marathon? That was just the cherry on top of a run that's increasingly just 120 ILs, back to back.

Review: It's a weird little branch off the Monkey Ball tree. Touch controls preclude the precise, frame-perfect strats of other games, making for a speedrun that's more just... playing the game normally, but really well and really fast. Which is what we get! Mission accomplished.

Review: It's a very, *very* new game, so the speedrun is still developing. General series skills carry over, so it's played competently, but there's only a few of the tricky skips that you'd see in another Mario Kart run. But it's a neat look into a speedrun in progress, and the couch was an absolute riot. Unless you're really turned off by Chat seizing on a dumb meme and running away with it, you'll probably enjoy.

Review: This run has been expunged due to accusations of serious misconduct against the runner.
Original Review: It's a long run, and it doesn't fit into any neat categories. It doesn't do a lot of RPG things, like hyper-specific battle strategies. It's glitchless, so no huge skips there. The story goes mostly unexplained, enough to follow along if you've played but not risking too many spoilers if you haven't. The most impressive gameplay are some of the bullet hell dodges, which were cool, but rather far between. Really, the bulk of the run was just memes - starting with just Deltarune fandom, then devolving into late-night madness. It did get a heavy dose of finale donation-flooding, so maybe avoid if you dislike that, but it was a fun, messy end to the event.
