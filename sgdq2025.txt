Review: This is a bit of a weird one. In a game with so many types of collectibles, some are still completely mandatory, have to route in hundreds, many as intended. Others are skipped almost entirely, through a series of absurdly precise glitches. So you get a blend of both worlds.

Review: There's a decent bit of out-of-bounds, but a lot of it's just playing the game efficiently, not needing to explore and scrutinize the levels. Definitely a primitive speedrun, this early in the game's life, but there's some interest to be found in that too.

Review: Every little thing in this game has a strat. Every phase of all fifty-something bosses, and movement between them - and runner and couch were well-equipped to explain every single one. Unfortunately they get rather samey by the end. If you're a die-hard Sekiro fan, you'll love this, but outsiders might not have as much appetite.

Review: The relentless begging to get the incentive met, distracted from the first half of the speedrun. The second half was dominated by redoing all the first levels, but with secrets this time. When there was commentary, it was talking over each other or spouting random jokes. It would have been better to just do the Easy Run and let it stand.

Review: I just really didn't like this run. Talking more about how the game's speedrun is basic hold-right-and-jump, than about the times it's *not*, doesn't give a good impression. And the "couch banter" was mostly cowboy accents and corpsing at their own jokes, which were mostly continuations of a bit from last GDQ (which I didn't even like then!). Late-night madness runs can be enjoyable, but this one wasn't.

Review: Most of the fun is from explaining the bonkers setup for the game, and the blind couch reacts, but there *is* an okay speedrun under it all. Some just-barely-possible unintended platforming, some boss quick kills. The only real dead time is an autoscroller right at the end, and even that's not too long, so it's a great run if you want something fun, but still like, actually a speedrun.

Review: Speedruns often shift how the game is played, and few do that more than Talos runners, who turned this slow puzzle game into a platformer. It's all clambering over walls or bringing boxes where they're not supposed to be. Fun, but even this short a run had more "nothing to say here, throw it over for donations" than I liked.

Review: Some runs work through precise execution, others through complex glitches, others through liberal application of speed tech. Here? It's cheese strats. Just different ways to do what the game is asking you to do, in ways the game clearly did not intend you to do. Add in some couch silliness, and it's a pretty fun run.

Review: A very broken speedrun, always on the edge of crashing the game entirely. A lot of inconsistency (necessitating a safety save be loaded), but it doesn't come off as unskilled. Despite being a 100% run of a collectathon, it still skips plenty, giving the couch things to talk about.

Review: We've seen this game many times before. How do you make it new again? How about making every enemy and boss, invisible? It's not just random difficulty, it emphasizes the AI manipulation that's the core of the run. And, when things go wrong, how well the runner has internalized the AI, to adapt to it.

Review: It's got all the hallmarks of a busted Castlevania run. Tricks to get late-game stats early? Check. Warping all around the map, melting through mandatory bosses? Check. Some weird memory-manipulation shenanigans? Check. Maybe a bit too technical to dive into fully during the run, but it's at least explained well enough to follow. Invalidated by using a few safety savestates, due to bad drop RNG.

Review: Another run carried hard by a charismatic couch and an enthusiastic audience. It's some out-of-bounds clips and platforming, sprinkled among just running through all the enemies or slugging it out in scripted wave fights. Fast-forwarding all the cutscenes left it with no dead time. But it was the banter that really makes this a run worth watching, despite the vocabulary constraints of a G-rated stream. But since this is my review site and I make the rules, I'll go ahead and say it for them: fuck nazis, whatever name they happen to call themselves this time.

They bypass a lot of it by not getting enough karma, good or bad, to get any of the more specific endings, but they don't even describe what doing that entails. It makes me think I'd have been better off watching a casual LP.

Review: This could really have benefitted from a good couch. The runner struggled a bit to give good commentary while also playing the game. A lot of basic things got missed - I don't think even "it's a Sonic racing fangame" got explicitly stated, although you could have guessed as much. But some of the trick explanations flew over my head, because the fundamentals were skipped over. Still a neat run, and it's clearly tricky to play well, but unfortunately tricky to watch as well.

Review: In contrast to all the kaizo romhacks, here's a "standard" one, trying to mimic the difficulty of baseline SMW. We still get some speed tech - shell jumps make an appearance - but it's much more like a vanilla SMW speedrun. Half the commentary was about how good the game looked, all the little details, and that's not a complaint from me.

But it's a randomizer, being played by two people across two games, working together. Pretty neat, even if they did end up using the hints to avoid going too far over estimate.

Review: Normally, we only see this sort of long couch tangents on the multi-hour JRPG runs, not something like this. It's like half of them were doing a speedrun, the other half were just shooting the shit. Which, granted, was pretty funny, but if you were hoping for a focus on the speedrun, you might be disappointed. (That said: wordle speedrun at gdq when?)

Review: Over the years, this run just keeps getting more and more busted. It's all clipping and prop-flying and menu glitches now. Gulch nails most of them, and the few struggles just highlight how finicky and precise some of them are. A little mood whiplash from the last run, going from electric hype to technical virtuosity, but still a fine run.

I'm sure if you were one of the players, this was a highlight of the year, but it's going to be hard to get that same vibe from the VOD.

It's under sixty minutes, and at least forty of them were the kind of thing that would be "the hardest trick" in any other game, and they just did. not. mess. up.

I certainly couldn't, and I don't think playing the game would have helped much. Just embrace the joy of the absurdity.

It never gets as busted as Twilight or Ocarina, you still see every dungeon, but you see a lot less of the later ones. Not the best introduction to the Zelda series speedruns, but as someone who's seen plenty of the other games, I was glad to see this one given some love. (Now I just need to beat Spirit Tracks before *it* gets in!)

Review: The king of the couch, moving up into the runner's seat. He doesn't disappoint, but he does play to his strengths - wasting a bit of time here and there, to show off fun parts of the game, or doing some funny banter with the couch. A wise choice - this game seems to have less speed tech than its sequel, it's not bad but it would have been stretched thin covering ninety minutes.

Review: I'm not even sure if I'll keep this on the site. It was a *fun* little game show, and bigger than their usual between-run activity. But it's not a speedrun. It's not a gameplay showcase. I don't typically review these, and I'm not sure how. It's Family Feud but with a speedrunning theme.

Review: Veering from hilarious insanity into technical speedrunning precision, this is maybe the closest race I've ever seen. They were trading places all the way through Mother Brain, maybe even escape sequence. And this is not an easy category! It was all tiny errors and the RNG of item drops - when you can only carry five super missiles, those play a big role. It's a dry, technical run, with only a bit of teasing between rival runners, but if you want pure speedrunning, it doesn't get much better than this.

Review: Kind of just another Metroid run, but not a bad one. 100% tends to make gameplay easier, so a game that was already on the easier side of the series, benefits from the added routing complication. And it was just a good clean run.

Review: These just don't get old. The gameplay would be acceptable for GDQ, even if they'd practiced it - but they're doing this with levels they've never seen before. And then we get an absolutely storybook plot, I don't even want to spoil the twists and turns for you. Might be a little hard for a complete outsider to follow, but even some casual Mario experience should keep you grounded.

Review: It's hard to explain exactly why this fell so flat for me. Maybe it was the repetition - the difficulty ramped up, yes, but it was hard to distinguish one song from another. They added some new challenges but mostly just got faster. The commentary gave history behind each song, but to an outsider very little of it mattered. If they'd given us some time to actually listen to the songs, maybe they'd be less of a blur, but maybe not, most sounded like the syncopated, arpeggio-filled mess that rhythm-game music often is, just a few tracks an outsider might recognize. Even the skill showcase stumbled, the last few songs seemed to be beyond the runner's ability (mostly by being absolutely impossible). Maybe I've just seen too many other rhythm-game runs - this was the third of the marathon - or maybe it just doesn't do anything the SGDQ2020 run didn't already do. But end of the day, all I can say is, I didn't enjoy this one much.

Review: It's a very, *very* new game, so the speedrun is still developing. General series skills carry over, so it's played competently, but there's only a few of the tricky skips that you'd see in another Mario Kart run. But it's a neat look into a speedrun in progress, and the couch was an absolute riot. Unless you're really turned off by Chat seizing on a dumb meme and running away with it, you'll probably enjoy.

Review: It's a long run, and it doesn't fit into any neat categories. It doesn't do a lot of RPG things, like hyper-specific battle strategies. It's glitchless, so no huge skips there. The story goes mostly unexplained, enough to follow along if you've played but not risking too many spoilers if you haven't. The most impressive gameplay are some of the bullet hell dodges, which were cool, but rather far between. Really, the bulk of the run was just memes - starting with just Deltarune fandom, then devolving into late-night madness. It did get a heavy dose of finale donation-flooding, so maybe avoid if you dislike that, but it was a fun, messy end to the event.
