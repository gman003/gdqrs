Review: This is a bit of a weird one. In a game with so many types of collectibles, some are still completely mandatory, have to route in hundreds, many as intended. Others are skipped almost entirely, through a series of absurdly precise glitches. So you get a blend of both worlds.

Review: There's a decent bit of out-of-bounds, but a lot of it's just playing the game efficiently, not needing to explore and scrutinize the levels. Definitely a primitive speedrun, this early in the game's life, but there's some interest to be found in that too.

Review: Every little thing in this game has a strat. Every phase of all fifty-something bosses, and movement between them - and runner and couch were well-equipped to explain every single one. Unfortunately they get rather samey by the end. If you're a die-hard Sekiro fan, you'll love this, but outsiders might not have as much appetite.

Review: The relentless begging to get the incentive met, distracted from the first half of the speedrun. The second half was dominated by redoing all the first levels, but with secrets this time. When there was commentary, it was talking over each other or spouting random jokes. It would have been better to just do the Easy Run and let it stand.

Review: We've seen this game many times before. How do you make it new again? How about making every enemy and boss, invisible? It's not just random difficulty, it emphasizes the AI manipulation that's the core of the run. And, when things go wrong, how well the runner has internalized the AI, to adapt to it.

Review: It's got all the hallmarks of a busted Castlevania run. Tricks to get late-game stats early? Check. Warping all around the map, melting through mandatory bosses? Check. Some weird memory-manipulation shenanigans? Check. Maybe a bit too technical to dive into fully during the run, but it's at least explained well enough to follow. Invalidated by using a few safety savestates, due to bad drop RNG.

Review: Another run carried hard by a charismatic couch and an enthusiastic audience. It's some out-of-bounds clips and platforming, sprinkled among just running through all the enemies or slugging it out in scripted wave fights. Fast-forwarding all the cutscenes left it with no dead time. But it was the banter that really makes this a run worth watching, despite the vocabulary constraints of a G-rated stream. But since this is my review site and I make the rules, I'll go ahead and say it for them: fuck nazis, whatever name they happen to call themselves this time.

Review: In contrast to all the kaizo romhacks, here's a "standard" one, trying to mimic the difficulty of baseline SMW. We still get some speed tech - shell jumps make an appearance - but it's much more like a vanilla SMW speedrun. Half the commentary was about how good the game looked, all the little details, and that's not a complaint from me.

Review: Normally, we only see this sort of long couch tangents on the multi-hour JRPG runs, not something like this. It's like half of them were doing a speedrun, the other half were just shooting the shit. Which, granted, was pretty funny, but if you were hoping for a focus on the speedrun, you might be disappointed. (That said: wordle speedrun at gdq when?)

Review: We've seen plenty of Critical Lvl 1 runs before, but they don't get boring. Only ever two mistakes, or even just bad RNG, away from dying, yet somehow not just beating the game, but doing it quickly. It was even a tighter race than those end times would make it seem.

Review: Over the years, this run just keeps getting more and more busted. It's all clipping and prop-flying and menu glitches now. Gulch nails most of them, and the few struggles just highlight how finicky and precise some of them are. A little mood whiplash from the last run, going from electric hype to technical virtuosity, but still a fine run.

Review: Don't expect anything like the level of technical mastery we've seen in other Tetris runs. The fun here was in audience participation - members of the audience, in-person or online, getting into the same lobby, playing against each other. I'm sure if you were one of the players, this was a highlight of the year, but it's going to be hard to get that same vibe from the VOD.

Review: Why does this game have a speedrun? Why does this speedrun have frame-perfect tricks?! It's really hard to judge this one, because it's just so weird. I can't say I've ever seen someone speedrun music theory before.

For something so linear, we got a surprising variety, bryo keeping it old-school while sapph went for the risky new tech. And it's still some very smooth movement from both of them.

Review: This showcase did a lot of things right. It started off slow enough to tell us how the game works, and escalated pretty steadily throughout, not often having a song that just seemed like more of the previous. Aside from a self-indulgent bit at the end, pretty good, but nowhere near as jaw-droppingly difficult as some games we've seen.

Review: A playthrough of a gimmick chart, designed for two players on each of the two screens. Potentially interesting, but doing it in no-fail mode because one runner has less than an hour of play in the game, kind of undercuts the whole "skill showcase" angle.

Review: We've seen SMO at many GDQs before. Top-level play is incredibly smooth and polished. How do you make it exciting again? How about *two* players, playing not just at the top level, but in perfect sync. It's under sixty minutes, and at least forty of them were the kind of thing that would be "the hardest trick" in any other game, and they just did. not. mess. up.

It never gets as busted as Twilight or Ocarina, you still see every dungeon, but you see a lot less of the later ones. Not the best introduction to the Zelda series speedruns, but as someone who's seen plenty of the other games, I was glad to see this one given some love.

He doesn't disappoint, but he does play to his strengths - wasting a bit of time here and there, to show off fun parts of the game, or doing some funny banter with the couch. A wise choice - this game seems to have less speed tech than its sequel, it's not bad but it would have been stretched thin covering ninety minutes.

Review: Veering from hilarious insanity into technical speedrunning precision, this is maybe the closest race I've ever seen. They were trading places all the way through Mother Brain, maybe even escape sequence. And this is not an easy category! It was all tiny errors and the RNG of item drops - when you can only carry five super missiles, those play a big role. It's a dry, technical run, with only a bit of teasing between rival runners, but if you want pure speedrunning, it doesn't get much better than this.
