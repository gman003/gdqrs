Review: This is a bit of a weird one. In a game with so many types of collectibles, some are still completely mandatory, have to route in hundreds, many as intended. Others are skipped almost entirely, through a series of absurdly precise glitches. So you get a blend of both worlds.

Review: There's a decent bit of out-of-bounds, but a lot of it's just playing the game efficiently, not needing to explore and scrutinize the levels. Definitely a primitive speedrun, this early in the game's life, but there's some interest to be found in that too.

Review: "And now we're out of bounds" was the refrain of this run. There's lots of it - but also lots of movement tech to accomplish it, and lots of sequence breaks enabled by it. The run just seemed to fly by, just as a speedrun should.

Review: Every little thing in this game has a strat. Every phase of all fifty-something bosses, and movement between them - and runner and couch were well-equipped to explain every single one. Unfortunately they get rather samey by the end. If you're a die-hard Sekiro fan, you'll love this, but outsiders might not have as much appetite.

Review: The relentless begging to get the incentive met, distracted from the first half of the speedrun. The second half was dominated by redoing all the first levels, but with secrets this time. When there was commentary, it was talking over each other or spouting random jokes. It would have been better to just do the Easy Run and let it stand.

Review: Some runs work through precise execution, others through complex glitches, others through liberal application of speed tech. Here? It's cheese strats. Just different ways to do what the game is asking you to do, in ways the game clearly did not intend you to do. Add in some couch silliness, and it's a pretty fun run.

Review: A very broken speedrun, always on the edge of crashing the game entirely. A lot of inconsistency (necessitating a safety save be loaded), but it doesn't come off as unskilled. Despite being a 100% run of a collectathon, it still skips plenty, giving the couch things to talk about.

Review: We've seen this game many times before. How do you make it new again? How about making every enemy and boss, invisible? It's not just random difficulty, it emphasizes the AI manipulation that's the core of the run. And, when things go wrong, how well the runner has internalized the AI, to adapt to it.

Review: It's got all the hallmarks of a busted Castlevania run. Tricks to get late-game stats early? Check. Warping all around the map, melting through mandatory bosses? Check. Some weird memory-manipulation shenanigans? Check. Maybe a bit too technical to dive into fully during the run, but it's at least explained well enough to follow. Invalidated by using a few safety savestates, due to bad drop RNG.

Review: Another run carried hard by a charismatic couch and an enthusiastic audience. It's some out-of-bounds clips and platforming, sprinkled among just running through all the enemies or slugging it out in scripted wave fights. Fast-forwarding all the cutscenes left it with no dead time. But it was the banter that really makes this a run worth watching, despite the vocabulary constraints of a G-rated stream. But since this is my review site and I make the rules, I'll go ahead and say it for them: fuck nazis, whatever name they happen to call themselves this time.
