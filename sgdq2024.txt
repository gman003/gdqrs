Review: A bit of a shaky start to the marathon, but after the stage nerves quieted down, a fun one. Not the most technically challenging platformer, but the skill lies in memorizing all these secrets - and we got non-stop commentary on them, with almost no downtime. Invalidated by missing one melon, unrecoverably.

Review: Speedrunning usually relies on extensive knowledge of the game, so a runner playing a set of levels they've never seen before is an unusual sight. The gameplay isn't as deep as other isometric RPGs, at least from the explanations we got, but it made for great banter.

Review: Slurpee may have been speedrunning Mega Man, but the couch was speedrunning Late Night Madness. Usually you don't see these sorts of absurd chains of non-sequiturs until 3AM a few days in, not two hours into the marathon. There is a solid speedrun hiding under here, but you're on your own when it comes to understanding it. Fortunately, Mega Man's a pretty straightforward game, when you're not using anything but the buster, and you've probably seen runs before.

Review: Pokemon runs come in three flavors: insane glitch fests, immaculately-routed RPG runs, and "a bunch of maniacs do a podcast while one of them plays through the game". This is the third sort. A good example of the type, I was laughing out loud at several bits, but if you were looking for Gen 1 exploits or Gen 4 memorization, this won't do it for you.

Review: Sonic '06 speedruns are far better than the game itself ever was. But what if the game was good? Turns out, it's still a good speedrun - P-06 has a ton of interesting movement options, nothing broken in the way of the original but still plenty of cuts and tricks. And this debut is accompanied by some breakneck self-commentary, detailing every little bit that goes into going fast.

Review: After reviewing speedruns for years, sometimes it's good to be reminded just how crazy some of this stuff is. Having a first-time watcher on the couch, to go 'woah' and 'wtf' to the screen wraps and glitches, or gasp at how close the optimal route comes to dying, brings some of that energy back.

Review: I'm sure there is someone out there who will enjoy this. The soft-spoken commentary, the sedate gameplay, the repetition, this would make excellent background noise. But as a speedrun, on the GDQ main stage? I'm sorry, I was just bored. The only parts that raised the energy levels above lethargic, were the mistakes.

Review: Yet another roguelike - seems to be a theme of the day - but the RNG in this one is a bit more manageable. Or at least mitigatable. Between the on-screen tracker and the commentary, it was easy enough for this outsider to follow, but the appeal is probably stronger for fellow spelunkers.

Review: A poker roguelike - so RNG stacked on RNG. Not surprising, then, that the run technically failed, but it completed with two out of the three decks so you saw plenty enough. It's all menuing and trying to build a sufficiently busted deck to beat the gauntlet the game throws down at you.

Review: It's Katamari. That's really the biggest factor in whether you'll like this or not. Going remote (especially with a non-English-fluent runner) made it less connected, but solo commentary while the runner focuses on the game is also a fine way to do a run.

Review: A nifty-looking run-and-gun, in the vein of a spruced-up Contra, and no glitches I can remember, just smooth shooting. If that sounds interesting, give this a shot, it's only half an hour.

Review: A run entirely based on a particular glitch to outright skip 90% of the game, that isn't particularly easy to understand or explain. There's other tricks, and some ordinary combat execution, but that's the core of the run.

Review: A run unfortunately hampered by technical problems. The runner's PC ran slower than normal, causing some issues executing certain tricks. Others were due to being remote, the commentator and host talking over each other. Despite that, it's still a pretty interesting speedrun - part collectathon, part shooter.

Review: "Glitchless" does not mean "as intended". The focus is so much on blinking about the map like a hummingbird on crack, that the last few levels are done pacifist simply because it's faster than picking up your weapons again. But wow, it's an impressive feat of movement.

Review: A more gameplay-focused commentary than we've gotten before, in Yakuza runs. Perhaps not the greatest choice - the combat tech leans heavily on a few powerful moves - but it's done with enough vibrancy to keep you engaged through the ninety-minute run. Though - much like the game itself - perhaps more aimed at series longtimers than at newcomers.

Review: It's a very broken run, this. Two broken weapons (and a busted trick) to blaze through the combat, though not without risk. Frequent though not universal out-of-bounds or other glitches. And then some routing to make sure every party member survives the suicide mission (accompanied by some prop comedy).

Review: Not as much of a non-sequitur as it sounds - if you've played more than 100 hours of Kerbal, go ahead and give this a shot. The shipless category means doing orbit transfers and high-speed docking with just spacesuit thrusters and excessive recoil. It's ridiculous and I am *here* for it. Plus, some juicy deets from devs on the couch.
