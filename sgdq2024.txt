Review: A bit of a shaky start to the marathon, but after the stage nerves quieted down, a fun one. Not the most technically challenging platformer, but the skill lies in memorizing all these secrets - and we got non-stop commentary on them, with almost no downtime. Invalidated by missing one melon, unrecoverably.

Review: Speedrunning usually relies on extensive knowledge of the game, so a runner playing a set of levels they've never seen before is an unusual sight. The gameplay isn't as deep as other isometric RPGs, at least from the explanations we got, but it made for great banter.

Review: Slurpee may have been speedrunning Mega Man, but the couch was speedrunning Late Night Madness. Usually you don't see these sorts of absurd chains of non-sequiturs until 3AM a few days in, not two hours into the marathon. There is a solid speedrun hiding under here, but you're on your own when it comes to understanding it. Fortunately, Mega Man's a pretty straightforward game, when you're not using anything but the buster, and you've probably seen runs before.

Review: Pokemon runs come in three flavors: insane glitch fests, immaculately-routed RPG runs, and "a bunch of maniacs do a podcast while one of them plays through the game". This is the third sort. A good example of the type, I was laughing out loud at several bits, but if you were looking for Gen 1 exploits or Gen 4 memorization, this won't do it for you.

Review: This is a run for the fans.

It wasn't the most thrilling race, even with a late push to regain the lead, but that's just the nature of the RNG.

Review: An extremely polished performance of this brutally hard, borderline-1HKO category. Bayo players are sure to be impressed, but the game has a bit too many autoscrollers to keep its momentum up, and relies on the same strats for much of the run. It's still good, and Pack absolutely killed it, but it's a run that would have benefited from more brevity.

Review: A game I'd never heard of, being run at the late hours, by a GDQ newcomer, who's the only person on the SRC leaderboard. I was not expecting a good run - but I got a great one. Fantastic movement, excellent commentary, some boss-melting strats. And though most of the commentary is focused on the tech, there's some charm to it, not just a recitation, and it sprinkles some humor in. A real hidden gem of the marathon.

Review: Well, 4AM on the first full day of GDQ might be a new record for a sleep-deprivation madness run. Unfortunately, I don't think it was good? It was mostly the couch and host getting caught in giggle-loops. And far more donation-reading than you'd expect from a run this short. Kind of a shame, it looks like it might have been a good run underneath it all, but they kept cutting off anything the runner tried to say. I'm sure there will be some who disagree with this rating and enjoy it anyways, but I found it frustrating and unrewarding to watch.

Review: A very weird plot for a game, but also a very, very broken speedrun. It's almost all out-of-bounds flings, save for an unfortunately long autoscroller. I wish we'd gotten a bit more about the actual game, because the speed tech got kind of repetitive, but I suppose there was only so much time.

Review: This is a hard run to describe, because very little stands out about it. It does nothing wrong, but also nothing special. It has some tricks, mostly abusing physics off items, and it got some mileage out of the bizarre story, but it feels like something I've seen a hundred times before. It's a filler run - and it does the job of filling that time. Fans of odd Genesis platformers should give it a shot, but I won't blame anyone for skipping this.

And this debut is accompanied by some breakneck self-commentary, detailing every little bit that goes into going fast.

Review: After reviewing speedruns for years, sometimes it's good to be reminded just how crazy some of this stuff is. Having a first-time watcher on the couch, to go 'woah' and 'wtf' to the screen wraps and glitches, or gasp at how close the optimal route comes to dying, brings some of that energy back.

Review: Yet another roguelike - seems to be a theme of the day - but the RNG in this one is a bit more manageable. Or at least mitigatable. Between the on-screen tracker and the commentary, it was easy enough for this outsider to follow, but the appeal is probably stronger for fellow spelunkers.

Review: This is one that will surely impress players of the series, since the game gets absolutely destroyed. But it offers little to us outsiders - the tech is just basic prop-flying to out of bounds, there's a long (relatively) autoscroller, and not enough time for any of the lore I assume this lite horror game must have. It's cleanly executed, but not impressive.

Review: The best part of this run is the epic shenanigans they get up to, during long live-action cinematics. The worst part of this run is how many long live-action cinematics it has. When there is actually speedrunning happening, it's good speedrunning - we get all kinds of out-of-bounds nonsense, skipping various amounts of the game. But then the pace will slam to a stop so we can watch cutscenes, not even playing the game, let alone speedrunning it. There's still stuff worth watching here, but expect something more akin to old JRPG runs than a modern action game.

Review: Wow. This was just an incredible run. Even as easy as he makes it look, this still looks brutally difficult, just non-stop classic FPS action. There's a handful of skips, via unintended platforming, and some tech involving spawn manipulation, but 90% of it is SR40 and murdering anything that gets in your way, before it reduces your health to 0. Excellent and entertaining commentary, with the only detraction being a late push for a donation incentive that crowded out the couch chatter.

Review: Between the mod, and the suggestibility of walls, this speedrun basically bears no resemblance to normal gameplay. It's very low on downtime, always something going on, but that something is more often clipping through fences or negating fall damage, than anything you'd see in a casual run. It's not uninteresting, but I can see why it's a bit niche of a speed game.

Review: A horror game mostly in the vein of Amnesia, with first-person movement and an emphasis on evading enemies. There's no good AI manips in this game, yet, which makes for a hectic, improv-heavy run - which was a great match for the vibes Asuka was bringing to the run. And despite the randomness, it was a very well-executed run, only a few seconds off a WR.

Review: This run, I think, tried to do too many things. It tried to be a deep, technical run, with lots of commentary, though it didn't seem that complex. It also piled on meme after meme - shouting "orb!", doing the Colossus scream from X-Men, all that. And then it also spent a lot of time trying to be a solemn commemoration. And all of those kept running over each other - tech explainers getting cut off by hollering, then abruptly cutting to a dedication. And to top it all off, this wasn't even that interesting as a speedrun - the best part was the novelty of a Game Boy classicvania, which didn't get touched on enough IMO. Castlevania fans will probably still enjoy this, but I can't say I did.

Review: It's a good run of a game that isn't very good to run. There's not all that much interesting going on - mostly just knowing how to trigger the plot to move forward, and how to get through the maze-like levels. Nor is the plot particularly interesting. But the couch and runner put so much energy into it, that it elevates it to... well, still just "pretty good for filler".

Review: I wonder if we could have known this was a Bethesda game, just from the glitches? It has a lot of the broken physics that Daggerfall and Morrowind speedruns use, just not quite as busted in a more linear game like this. Unfortunately, in a run this short, struggling to nail even one trick can sap the pace, and 6AM is a hard hour to bring the hype in, but it's still not a bad run.

The main trick is an interface glitch on the level select, to start levels that haven't been unlocked, so the run is, if done properly, just the first level, and the last level. And some sort of technical jank made the loading times (covered up by cutscenes) absolutely abysmal. There was actual gameplay for less than half of the runtime, and it was not even impressive gameplay.

Review: It lacks in polish, and the commentary is pretty shallow, a lot of "go up this staircase" without going into any deeper strategy. But even for a 2.5D shooter of this era, it's such a weird game, that it's at least interesting to watch and be bewildered by.

Review: Obviously the draw here is the novelty of the console - this is just the second Virtual Boy run, and the first in-person. But beneath that, it's a solid platformer, not the most technical or demanding, but fluid in motion. It's got a bit too much downtime to be a must-watch, but it's worth seeing for reasons beyond just "is a Virtual Boy game".

Review: A more gameplay-focused commentary than we've gotten before, in Yakuza runs. Perhaps not the greatest choice - the combat tech leans heavily on a few powerful moves - but it's done with enough vibrancy to keep you engaged through the ninety-minute run. Though - much like the game itself - perhaps more aimed at series longtimers than at newcomers.

Review: It's missing a lot of the JRPG marathon staples. The menuing is unremarkable. The battle routing involves no flashy combos or game-breaking abuses, just lots of healing and some battle items. But it makes up for it with more intricate overworld movement than any other 16-bit JRPG speedrun - the Zelda dungeon influences are clearly felt. And it's well-commentated, explaining everything that's going on, both in the run and the story.

Review: This was not a bad run.  The couch was better than you'd expect from early-hours filler. The problem is just that it is a *new* run. There's one really powerful trick, used in a few places, but much of the run is spent playing as-intended, or in long cutscenes. Execution is better than casual, for sure, but nothing compared to other speedruns. If the game gets some better skips, over the less interesting parts of the game, or perfects the movement a bit more, it'll be a real treat to come back and watch this larval version. But as of now? Eh.

Review: I'm sure there was a ton of micro-optimization going on here, but all the notable speed tech was just ways to skip cutscenes, often by just restarting the console. And even with that, way too much of this run was cutscenes or autoscrollers to get an easy recommend. At least the cutscenes were funny?

Review: The least-popular entry in the mega-popular FF7 compilation, the speedrun solves some of the problems - tanky bosses are oneshot, not even with a glitch but with maximized mechanics - but not others - the bland, repetitive environments. Maybe a deeper explanation of the plot would have helped, but maybe it's just a consequence of running a bad-but-not-funny-bad game. Still, I can't say I regret having a chance to see the game in action.

Sure, just spam a hundred enemies here, or take away some intended platforms to force a harder route. It's not easy to execute this well, but it's not as entertaining as the other romhacks on display.

Review: Yet another run that probably left every Destiny player's jaw on the floor, but had me mentally checking out far too often. The tricks that are impressive to see executed by a single player, when intended for six? Yes, that's fun to watch. The first time. Seeing it repeated, in order to grind through a squad-sized health bar? Less appealing. The post-run showoff of the hard mode fight is entirely skippable, it's literally just the above, but more so.

Review: Some games are fun to watch played well, because they have such high skill ceilings that reward better and better skill. This is not one of those. The platforming is downright terrible - it's been in Awful Block before - but Kon (just Kon, for this run) gets through it well. It's mostly just an excuse to make silly jokes, though.

Review: A very weird and silly game - but also clearly a hard one. Most of the speed tech is just "don't die", but there's a few other elements that avoid making it just an autoscroller. So it's a rare Silly Block entry that's also a perfectly watchable speed game on its own.

Review: We come now to the frayed edges of Silly Block, with this low-budget baseball-tinged demon-slaying brawler. It's a unique thing, for sure - and not even a bad speedrun. The tech is limited but more than enough to fill fifteen minutes, even if you don't find "low-budget baseball-tinged demon slaying" to be interesting on its own.

Review: The upgrade to Challenge Mode (altering trainer's parties to make them harder) makes the battle strats a lot more interesting, and there's some cool RNG manipulation at the start... but this is just such a long run. The early-game energy fades, and then it gets snarled in Team Plasma cutscenes, and then it gets so overleveled that even the Cynthia bonus at the end is a pushover. If you like Pokemon runs on the dry side, focused on gameplay, this is what you're looking for, but it's not for everyone.

Review: This felt much less RNG-heavy than past Mario Kart runs. Yes, it still happens, but blue shells can be dodged most of the time, and only one skip seems to require a specific item. Nor is it as full of glitches as the N64 or Wii iterations. It's just an hour of good racing - snaking, drifting, turboing all over the place.

Review: High-level tetris play is impressive to watch. TGM is one of the better variants of the game for that lightning-fast, smooth gameplay. This? Wasn't it. The intended run imploded - the speed strats are inherently risky - and the back half was just showing off 20G mode. My biggest complaint was actually the host - cutting off the runner's explanation, then delivering a long ad read over the most critical moment of the run.

Review: A weird combination of bullet hell and MMO raid, this is a hard game to read, as an outsider. Maybe better explanations would have helped, but it's too fast-paced for that to help but so much. I think this is just a run for people who've played the game and can grok what's going on. Otherwise, just enjoy the bunny ears, the charming attempts at explaining the story, and the bullet-hell dodging.

Review: I probably didn't need to review this one, because you already know whether you want to watch this, based purely on how much you like dogs. This is a shameless novelty run, and that's fine. But to analyze it - a dog playing Gyromite worked, because the game was built around commanding a somewhat recalcitrant partner (R.O.B.). Baseball, felt a bit more like JSR was playing the game, via a very laggy and inconsistent controller. I'll give them points for the baseball theatrics, but whether that will carry the run for you is hard to say. It was, at least, more fun to watch than *actual* baseball.

Smooth but detailed commentary, a mod to cut out autoscrollers, clean execution. It's not as rambunctious as some runs, perhaps, but it keeps the focus on the speedrun.

Review: The first half of this run - the first three games - was one of the best THPS runs I've seen. Engaging, rapid-fire, well-commentated. But when it went into THPS4, the pace suddenly dropped, everything came with dead time, and even the commentary was aware that the run was shifting into low gear. This made me much more interested in future early THPS runs, but reinforced just how much I find the later games boring to watch.

Review: Oh, it turns out you can just yeet yourself straight to the end of the main quest, and finish the game in under five minutes. It's too fast to allow proper explanations, so it relies on the previous All Main Quests run to do the heavy lifting, but it also repeats a good bit of it, so consider this an optional dessert.

The bots are unthreatening and there's none of the RNG mess you see in Mario Kart, so if you're looking for a more technical sort of run, this might be just the thing.

And being still in the zeitgeist, I'm sure many people will have recently finished it themselves, in far more than fifteen minutes. To them, it's an easy recommend.

Review: It's a GDQ staple for a reason - the creativity of the levels, the skill of the runners, are unmatched after thirty-four years of playing the same game. About the only thing separating this from a fifth star, was the one-sidedness of the competition, and a few of the levels being a bit too sadistic, getting stuck on one screen just a bit too long. But it had no shortage of hype moments to rope me back in.

Review: And now we reach the now-obligatory rhythm game showcase of the run. This was certainly impressive, but it simply did not have the variety to sustain this long a time block. Incremental increases in difficulty are almost impossible to judge, past the point where a novice stops being able to keep up - and obviously this goes far, far beyond that. If it had had more interesting gimmicks, or even just a broader range of music being played, I would have found more enjoyment, but no, it's ninety minutes of Japanese hardcore. nb1rs absolutely proved themself a god gamer, but you can get the same experience by watching the first few songs as an intro, then skipping straight to the "boss" section.

Review: If the blind kaizo race wasn't polished enough for your tastes, this will be more your style. MightyMouse seems to do the impossible with ease, casually one-shotting many levels of this brutally difficult romhack. Even when he sometimes struggles, it just shows how hard this game is. And it's all accompanied by an expert kaizo player and the developer himself.

Review: The unavoidable problem that runs of this game face, is the massive autoscroller right in the middle. That would kill the pacing of even the most exciting runs. But even outside that, this isn't a particularly enthralling game. It often feels as if it's locked into the same speed as a casual run, and even when describing the tech, it comes off more as "tricks to keep the AI from further wasting your time" than anything. Joestar makes a valiant attempt but this just isn't a game that's interesting to watch.

Review: The perennial shmup high-score showcase of the marathon. This one had relatively simpler mechanics, but a much harder to read screen, and execution seemed less polished than previous runs, lots of unintended deaths. Enjoyable, but not the best we've seen.

Review: It's a run with a lot of skips, of various sizes, all using fairly straightforward (if unintended) movement. Simple to follow, even with some clunky commentary delivery, and short enough to not run out of variety or things to talk about. It's not spectacular, but it's 4AM on the final day, it doesn't have to be.

Review: This commentary just doesn't do enough to explain how the game's non-euclidean geometry works. It just presents you with some weird stuff, says "yeah isn't this weird", and doesn't even try to explain it. And having played the game, I'll grant that it doesn't rely often on the details of hyperbolic geometry, especially not in the Any%. But I still came away from this disappointed. It doesn't even do a good job of just presenting you with the weird - the couch member that went in blind, never did much in the way of reacting, didn't ask questions, the way an audience surrogate should.

Review: A pixel-art indie platformer that goes by a bit too fast to actually explain properly. It's neat and it doesn't suffer from dead time, and it was intuitive enough what was going on on-screen, but as an outsider, it was hard to tell if this was normal Curse Crackers gameplay, or if this was like, ridiculously good. But at this length, it's an easy recommend if you've ever played the game.

Review: Yet another entry in the Mega Man-like genre, but one that easily earns its place by avoiding some of the more irritating conventions of the genre. Fast, clean movement, quick boss strats, and a little bit of routing logic. It's light on glitches but great on commentary. Definitely worth checking out, if you're at all interested.

Review: It's just some really good movement. It's a lot like Mario Odyssey, in terms of just sheer options - and don't think for a moment that "Restricted" means "as dev intended", because there's skips and shortcuts all over the place. It's just all done using the intended toolset, not using infinite-height glitches.

Review: A very clean run, but not the most interesting one. An early slate of levels were trivialized by intended skips, many later levels were broken by unintended skips. A lot of what remained, was autoscrollers, or auto-scrollery bosses. Some of the skips were cool, and the execution was *tight* when it mattered, but there was more dead time than I'd have liked.

Review: Up until the final boss, this was a solid run, especially for such a new game. Plenty of tech, including some of a glitchy nature, though not much polish. But - yeah, no getting around it, almost half the run being dying to the end boss over and over? Completely takes the sails out of it, and wrecks any competitive aspect to the race.

Review: I didn't believe it when I first saw it on the schedule. Sure, we've seen Bubzia beat the game blindfolded. He's beaten 120 Star, blindfolded. But a *randomizer*? Even some struggling at the end only knocks this down to a merely excellent run, and not an all-time great, showcasing not just execution, but rapid planning and exploration.The ten-minute star rush afterward was also a joy to watch.

Review: Baldur's Gate 3 has indeed captured the spirit of a tabletop RPG, in that abusing mechanics that weren't even designed for combat, can be absurdly busted. This might be glitchless, but don't expect to see anyone throwing fireballs or throwing down with swords - it's the sort of run that would have a human dungeon master going "well, that works, I guess". Invalidated by use of a safety save, after a mistake.
