Review: I found this run disappointing. Instead of showing off "Mega Man, but custom remixes", it hammered us with "other games, remade in a Mega Man engine". Neat as a oneoff, tiresome as a full half-hour. And the runner came off as more obnoxious than enthusiastic.

Review: F-Zero runs tend to be pretty precise and technical, lots of strats intended for IL runs rather than full-game. But the sheer length of this got pretty hard after a while.
NM: not sure I got the right category, doesn't include the runner?

Review: Not the most broken Zelda game, by a long shot, but still one that makes use of lots of glitches. There's long stretches of normal-ish gameplay, especially early on, but broken up by some extravagant layer breaks and some RNG manips. Excellent commentary makes it easy to digest.

Review: It's five minutes repeating the opening of the last run, then twenty minutes of the runners quietly failing the out of bounds stuff, because they didn't practice this run at all before making it an incentive. Watch until the first reset, if you watch at all.

Review: I often call out excellent commentary, because it can make or break a run. Here, the stumbling and meandering commentary broke it. The game's systems came across as opaque and confusing, the runners had to constantly remind each other what the route or fallbacks were, and the plot explanation was threadbare.

Review: It's hard for me to pin down why this run felt like a bit of a slog. It wasn't bad, it had some decent tricks to it, the commentary did everything it needed to do. Maybe it was just the reliance on quicksaving to land tricks, combined with the often-slow load times.

Review: An extremely difficult run, I'm always surprised to see a Halo legendary run make it into a marathon because it never feels safe. There's a huge element of pure play-game-good going on, but there's also a good few prop launches and other skips, never anything major but enough to spice things up.

Review: This run had all the right ingredients, but failed to use them well. Having a dev on the couch, but focusing them on play-by-play commentary, feels wasteful. The speedrun was almost pure play-game-good, but it's hard to tell how much of the flashiness was skill, and how much was normal gameplay. And the nearly-static vtuber image just emphasized how monotonous things felt. The end result was something that felt more like a quiet Let's Play than a speedrun.

Review: This is a very one-note run, so your enjoyment will depend on exactly how much you like super-precise, endurance-test bullet-hell shmups. If an hour-plus of that sounds like heaven, you're in for a treat. But if you want some more variety, you'll have to find it elsewhere. Even the commentary didn't shake things up much, this is a pretty bad primer on Touhou lore.

Review: It's another one-trick run. Glitch one character's charge-attack power so it never ends, use that to just move fast, to jump over puzzles, to clip through boss arenas, basically just skip the entire game. It's short enough that some high energy could have saved it, but I couldn't feel it.

Review: This game is one of the pinnacles of speedrunning. At the high level, the movement is so fluid, so non-stop, that it puts almost every other game to shame. The routing is so efficient, so ruthlessly focused on speed, that they've cut out basically every bit of downtime. This is an hour of pure platforming prowess, and the only reason it didn't get a fifth star is how many of the most aggressive tricks failed.

They didn't seem to need any special strats for two players, one controller, just good coordination and maybe skipping the most difficult tricks.

Review: This is a run to watch more for the Live Texan Reaction than for the actual speedrun. The on-screen action is just a light-gun shooter with no light guns, lots of mashing and memorizing enemy spawns, but the exaggerated cowboy yeehaws from the couch and host are the real highlight.

Review: A pretty straightforward 1CC arcade brawler run, I don't recall a single glitch or exploit. It's just play-game-good, but this run's short enough that it doesn't suffer for it.
WRs: too hard to figure out, can't spot either runner on it anyways
TODO: check what port they're playing, if any

Review: A pretty unpolished run, even looking past the heavy RNG. But it's a novel Zelda run, not similar to any of the five other Zeldas in the marathon. As a series fan, it was neat to see, but it won't hold much appeal to most.

Review: The remaster broke a lot of old speedrun tricks, making this a lot more rough around the edges than classic Metroid Prime runs. There's still clips and OoBs and sequence breaks, but there's fewer of them and they're less consistent.

Review: Long Pokemon RPG runs are a GDQ tradition. This was not one of the better ones. The unavoidable battle animations dragged the pace, the race opened up early and never closed, and the couch just did not have the chemistry of the best Pokemon runs. If you really want to watch a Pokemon run, this is likely still what you want, but

Review: A cool run, but lacking in both explanations and variety. I'm still not sure exactly what inputs each symbol requires, and it pretty quickly passed the level where the unpracticed watcher can gauge the difficulty. It's just a stream of fast-moving glowing bars and dots.
