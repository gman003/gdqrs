Review: I found this run disappointing. Instead of showing off "Mega Man, but custom remixes", it hammered us with "other games, remade in a Mega Man engine". Neat as a oneoff, tiresome as a full half-hour. And the runner came off as more obnoxious than enthusiastic.

Review: F-Zero runs tend to be pretty precise and technical, lots of strats intended for IL runs rather than full-game. But the sheer length of this got pretty hard after a while.

Review: Not the most broken Zelda game, by a long shot, but still one that makes use of lots of glitches. There's long stretches of normal-ish gameplay, especially early on, but broken up by some extravagant layer breaks and some RNG manips. Excellent commentary makes it easy to digest.

Review: It's five minutes repeating the opening of the last run, then twenty minutes of the runners quietly failing the out of bounds stuff, because they didn't practice this run at all before making it an incentive. Watch until the first reset, if you watch at all.

Review: A fast-forgotten game, the speedrun's not particularly polished but it's got a lot of skips, not just completely ignoring the stealth gameplay to run from level trigger to level trigger. There's some OoB and more than a few door clips, while still not trivializing everything. And DemonicRobots gives some pretty engaging commentary.

Review: A cool run, very efficient routing and some precise tricks, but the crew just didn't have enough material to fill two hours. Even with some crowd gimmicks, they threw things over to donation reading far too often, and for far too long. Made it feel too much like just an experienced LP rather than a speedrun.

Review: I often call out excellent commentary, because it can make or break a run. Here, the stumbling and meandering commentary broke it. The game's systems came across as opaque and confusing, the runners had to constantly remind each other what the route or fallbacks were, and the plot explanation was threadbare.

Review: Another cool rhythm game showcase, with as much variety on display as the game has, but that's sadly just not that much. Solo, solo across both boards, team, and modded, and they have most of their gameplay in common. The commentators were informative but unenthused, and this far above casual skill levels, it's hard to tell how impressed one should be at anything. Combine that with the friction of a remote run, and an uncooperative host, and it's only a *pretty good* run.
PS: Prolix. Learn when to stfu and stop getting in the runners' way. I know it's your job to hype up the donation incentives, but you *repeatedly* got told "time for one quick donation before the next song" and then gave a long exhortation to donate towards an incentive, then read a long donation, and by the time you were done the song was halfway over. You were actively making this run worse, in a very noticeable way. You kept anyone from even remarking on Chez's insane 99,950 score.

Review: The whole appeal of a run like this is the complex explosive card combos. But with terrible audio mixing, terrible delivery, and a seeming lack of *effort* in giving good explanations... this was 
twenty minutes of watching rectangles fly around while voiceactors shouted at each other over garbled explanations. Giving the only detailed commentary of the run, at incomprehensibly fast speeds as a joke, came across as insulting, rather than funny.

Review: This is the kind of run that's easy to follow and exciting to watch. The skill here is communication and efficiency - perhaps the only downside is that commentary kept getting cut off by runners' orders. But the energy is unbelievable for a run in this time slot, even before they realized they were probably on WR pace.

Review: This run could have benefited tremendously from a good couch. The game has a famously intricate story - we heard nothing about it. The run has some cool tricks - these were barely explained. The community is kinda freaking out about a new game for the first time since 1996 - this was mentioned once. A half-hour run wouldn't have time to do all of these justice, but it could perhaps have done *one* of them.

Review: Kind of an unremarkable speedrun. The exploits amp up over time, a lot of Act 1 is played as in Glitchless but much of Act 2 is skipped entirely. But it's neither random enough for that to hold interest, nor polished enough for the execution to impress.

Review: Glitches? In an Elder Scrolls game? Perish the thought! There's some decent variety, since most games have *different* glitches, but some of the individual games can get repetitive. Commentary is very informative, but unfortunately monotone.

Review: It's hard for me to pin down why this run felt like a bit of a slog. It wasn't bad, it had some decent tricks to it, the commentary did everything it needed to do. Maybe it was just the reliance on quicksaving to land tricks, combined with the often-slow load times.

Review: An extremely difficult run, I'm always surprised to see a Halo legendary run make it into a marathon because it never feels safe. There's a huge element of pure play-game-good going on, but there's also a good few prop launches and other skips, never anything major but enough to spice things up.

Review: This run had all the right ingredients, but failed to use them well. Having a dev on the couch, but focusing them on play-by-play commentary, feels wasteful. The speedrun was almost pure play-game-good, but it's hard to tell how much of the flashiness was skill, and how much was normal gameplay. And the nearly-static vtuber image just emphasized how monotonous things felt. The end result was something that felt more like a quiet Let's Play than a speedrun.

Even the commentary didn't shake things up much, this is a pretty bad primer on Touhou lore.

Review: This game is one of the pinnacles of speedrunning. At the high level, the movement is so fluid, so non-stop, that it puts almost every other game to shame. The routing is so efficient, so ruthlessly focused on speed, that they've cut out basically every bit of downtime. This is an hour of pure platforming prowess, and the only reason it didn't get a fifth star is how many of the most aggressive tricks failed.

Review: The game's difficulty comes more from clunky controls and bad design, than actual challenge. The biggest obstacle is just enemies deciding to block as long as they want to, no good way to break through. The execution on everything was pretty lackluster, and the run technically didn't finish because it game-overed on the last phase of the final boss, due as much to RNG as anything else. And it wasn't even all that funny.

Review: This game has probably the best first-person movement mechanics, and Blaidan went full send with them. He didn't nail every trick first-try, but the only one he actually missed was an absurd one at the end that no other runner even goes for. This was an astonishing run from start to end.

Review: I have long found Crash runs to be too repetitive, too focused on clean execution of a very limited amount of tech over too long a game. Expanding it to the full trilogy did not help. If you're familiar enough with the games to be impressed by an hour-plus of near-perfect hobzslides, you'll love this, but most watchers will be better off watching other runs.

Review: A shorter JRPG run than most, but unfortunately not a better one. The RNG is stratospheric and the game is only marathon-safe because of constant quicksaves and relatively fast loads. The lore, at least as explained here, is pretty generic, and the combat system has some neat combo potential that isn't given enough detail. Even the runner and couch seem to admit this is a filler run. Not bad filler, but still filler.

Review: How did this game get so technical? I thought I was just bad at it as a kid, but no, apparently it really is just a hard game, and the speedrun has to avoid certain intended routes because they're unreliable, not just because they're slow. Other than some errors in the last stage, this was really clean for such a trick-dense run, but all of the tricks are pretty simple to understand, no QPUs here.

Review: The QoL features of the Pixel Remasters make for a much faster-paced speedrun, compared to most 16-bit JRPGs. Lots of really granular strats, some impressive adaptations to bad RNG, and even a bit of storytelling. Or at least some poking fun at the number of characters that come back after a dramatic sacrifice.
