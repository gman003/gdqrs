Review: A dubious choice to start the marathon with. This feels more like late-night filler than a triumphant show-starter, not bad but not as good as I was expecting. The run isn't super polished (as expected from a game this new), and could have benefitted from a good couch to explain things better. Axel's self-commentary was rather stilted, low-energy, and sometimes hard to understand. It's a jargon-heavy game and not all of it is obvious just from watching.

Review: Another 2021 game being run, this one so broken that it bears almost no resemblance to the normal game flow. It's just movement, cutscene skips, and a few glitches to completely break the intended pathing. I don't think a single bit of combat happened. But that got it down to twelve minutes, and Seraphin kept a very good pace.

Review: It's a classic of the speedrunning scene, and coolkid is one of the best. You've probably seen Mega Man runs before, so it's the expected series of wall-clips, boss quick-kills, and i-frame abuse... but it's a good performance, with just a few minor mistakes that keep things interesting. Mithical9 put some serious effort in on commentary, a bit scripted but very informative, without being too dry.

Review: As expected from a recent game, it's inconsistently executed, and has long stretches of as-intended gameplay, but it still has more tech than I expected from such a game. The runners clearly love the game, but perhaps more as a casual run than a speedrun... I'm tempted to check it out but I doubt I'd try to run it.

Review: A bit of a mixed bag. There's a good bit of content skipping - jumping over fight triggers, and some OoB - but it also does have to do a lot of combat that Easy NG+ makes trivial. The artstyle is lovely, and it sounds like Samurai Jack fans love it, but this run skips all the fun references, so I'm not sure it's great for them. It's not quite a "friends on couch Let's Play", it does feel like an actual speedrun, but it definitely has some of those vibes. If that's what you're into, might be worth a watch, but it's not a must-see by any stretch.

Review: Bullets described it as a chill run, which I don't think is perfectly accurate. It's a very slow run - for every thirty-second level played, there's another thirty or forty seconds of cutscenes and transitions. It's not a bad platformer run when it's actually platforming, but so much of it just... isn't. And the gameplay we do get isn't outstanding enough to make up for it - a few tight cycles, a few shortcuts, a few major skips, but nothing that justifies the tedium between stages.

Review: This is a hard game to figure out even playing as intended, so the speedrun only adds to the confusion. The commentary tries to keep up with the speed tech but this is probably not a great run if you want to understand things but have not played the game. If you have, or if you don't care, it's a nice fast-moving puzzle speedrun, with very little downtime.

Review: This run is polished enough that even one mistake can put you far behind... and unfortunately, one runner just didn't make any mistakes. So it became a bit boring, might have been better as a solo run, but maybe it was just bad luck. There's a bit of tech to the game, a few clips and a lot of tightly-routed movement, but it's not the most interesting, and splitting the attention detracted a bit from the polish.

Review: One under-appreciated aspect of week-long marathons is that they offer a chance for smaller communities to showcase themselves. This seems like a game that's still ripe for some more optimization, some more glitch-hunting. It's a perfectly competent speedrun already, and Breadghost did a good job showing it, but it's not at the level of polish of the bigger games. So if you want a chance to make your mark, maybe look into this game. It seems promising.

Some lengthy less-broken sections do drag the pace down, but it's broken up by a few other amusing glitches, like bringing a giant mech into a boss fight never meant for it. And having a developer, even just a QA and community management one, is always a plus.

Review: A licensed-but-not-shovelware zeldalike, this has a lot of the right elements. Lots of commentary, even if not necessarily the best, and a glitch is used to bypass huge amounts of grinding, which is always nice to see. But it just didn't seem that good of a speedrun? The movement is nowhere near as skilled as Zelda 1 speedrunning, and the combat seems downright trivial when they bother with it at all. And there's just so much backtracking and walking through empty screens - the couch keeps things engaging, but that doesn't make the gameplay any better. Seems like a runner and couch to follow, but maybe not a game to get into.

Review: A short bonus run, a seldom-played category allowing the use of the debug menu, pretty much exclusively for warping around the map. A common idea for a bonus run, but rather slapdash in execution, since the runner hadn't really practiced it, and nobody seemed to be on the same page with presenting it. Still, if you sat through the Any% run, it's probably worth sticking around for.

Review: This was hard to watch mostly because the framerate was so low - NES games are laggy but not "three frames a second" laggy, so I think this was just tech issues. Beyond that, it's a fairly mundane action platformer, with commentary mostly running play-by-play, or explaining the name differences between US and Japan. (Which I didn't get at all, because I never watched Power Rangers.)

The run is sort of reminescent of Shovel Knight runs - mostly just good platforming, mixed with some very tight damage boosts and a few death warps. Excellent commentary, really helping to sell how close Vanni was cutting it sometimes.

Review: Long JRPG runs are divisive - their focus on deep knowledge rather than mechanical execution, and their length, makes them a different beast than most other speedruns. This was one of the better ones, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a long JRPG run. The commentary was good but inevitably jargon-heavy, the execution was pretty clean, and fortunately this game allow you to skip cutscenes. The focus on evading overworld encounters and highly-scripted boss fights reminds me more of Pokemon runs than other Final Fantasy runs I've seen, but it was enjoyable at that.

There's still lots of small clips and tricks, and I still question why NG+ is the norm for this series, when it makes combat downright trivial and doesn't seem to open up movement options. Be aware there's some major bitrate issues - I don't know if it's just the game, or lingering tech issues, but it was a pretty blocky image much of the time.

Review: A new game in the PS1 RE style, which is probably the biggest draw to the run. Everything else is middling - the commentary is constant but not very informative, the strats are as unpolished as you'd expect of a year-old game, and the game itself holds few surprises in its gameplay. It's mostly just walking around enemies and memorizing puzzle solutions, which isn't great to watch. One for the horror fans, but not a must-watch for even them.

The only commentary given was explaining the story, barely any mention of how the game plays, let alone strategies. It's interesting as a bite-sized Let's Play, and somewhat improved from the last appearance, but I still am not sure what the appeal is supposed to be.

Review: One of the upsides of online marathons is that it allows runners from around the globe to participate, not just those who can travel to the US. We've seen many great runs that simply wouldn't have been possible at an in-person event... but this was not one of them. Perhaps with a couch team that actually spoke English fluently, this could have been good, but both explanations and jokes fall flat when I can barely understand them. That can't help but overshadow everything else. It had some good ingredients - a runner in costume, some funny jumpscare reactions, and I think a lot of memes - but you're practically better off watching this on mute.
NM: Kind of unsure on dev name, hard to find any info on this game besides Let's Plays, but it does match with what I'd found for PIEN last year

Review: This was like a lot of horror speedruns - dodging enemies while bouncing between triggers and a few mandatory fights. The run was surprisingly sloppy for a WR - several route mistakes (she'd been practicing Yin Phase), and some safety strats (though some seem like they might be faster). It was still decently executed overall, but the real draw here was the commentary, trying to explain the story in a sarcastic and low-spoiler way.

Review: Another run that did several things well, but didn't really know what it was trying to be. The couch tried to give informative, speed-tech explanations, but ran out of steam halfway through, as this isn't really the most technical speed game. Haru mostly kept silent (not being fluent in English) but seemed to be more suited for a relaxed, charming run, fitting the vibes of the game, frequently trying to push Royal Rainbow! as a meme. Maybe some better coordination beforehand would have helped?

Review: This run had more speed tech than I expected, given that it's a rail shooter. It's still very autoscroller-y but not as bad as I was expecting. The strats are actually more about managing the auto-balance and taking the right branches, rather than simply typing fast - TPC was no slouch but I've seen faster typists. But he kept up some solid self-commentary, only occasionally running out of things to say, making for an engaging run.

Sure, it's amazing to see those long hovers and precise dribbles, but the pacing on this was far, far too slow. There was perhaps enough variety for a half hour - there was nothing that seven minutes of hovering through rings gave us, that the first minute did not, and for all their talk of specialization and unique levels, I think half of them were Superman 64 solve-my-maze tedium. Commentators spent as long shilling the game and the workshop as they did explaining tech, because there fundamentally isn't that much tech to this game.

Review: This is kind of an awkward speedrun. The first half is stuffed with cutscenes, and the first cycle is played almost entirely as intended. Then it's a trek over to the Deku Palace and a very glitchy wrong-warp straight to end of the final dungeon. It's very well-explained for something so technical - Gymnast and couch could probably teach a comp sci class better than my actual college professors did - but it's unfortunate that so much time is spent on the fixed-length intro.

Review: The game is much more like conventional Zelda games, at least in the top-down perspective, clear dungeons and bosses, and the very bouncy level design. And the cutscenes, though still not good, are at least less memetastically awful. But that makes it not quite awful enough to be a good Awful Block run, while still not being good enough to be outside Awful Block. It's mostly just tedious loading times, opaque quest design, and some killing bosses with chip damage because going a few screens over to grab the intended weapon would take longer.

Review: Not the most broken game of Awful Block, but not a bad watch. It's got a weird mix of actual speed tech, bad game design, and a very cringe story, but they didn't actually spend too long talking about the last. If you want a very exploitable 3D brawler, this one is up there, but they played it a bit too straight for an Awful Block game.

Review: The fun part of Awful Game speedruns is making fun of them, but Grumpmeister doesn't really do any of that. He's just playing a game with awful music and a lot of lag, but trying to sing its praises regardless. There's very limited tech - the game is mostly autoscrollers - so it's not a good speed game, but if you're not riffing on it, where's the fun?

Review: Now this is some proper Awful Block material.

Review: It's a bit hard to show off games with bad controls, because if you're good, you mostly don't see it. But there's enough obvious jank that this is well within Awful Block turf, and the surprisingly good animations (for a DOS game) make it an interesting watch regardless. Short, but I'm not sure it would have held interest for much longer.

Review: Frame-perfect is a lot easier with a single-digit framerate. There's some novelty from being a Game.Com title, but that mostly just makes it not that great of a game. Commentary was informative but very unenthused - with Awful Block, I've come to expect excitement, either hyping up a game that does not deserve it, or unreservedly hating a game that does. This was more "yeah, it's a Game.Com game, the framerate is awful, we don't know how all these glitches happen, most of them aren't useful, I can't tell which level I'm on because they all look the same".

Review: A sort of shitpost game - the platforming is extremely limited, the combat is simple as possible, and the art is the best MSPaint can provide. Which makes for a pretty decent Awful Block game. Real Gamer% added a lot of extra RNG in the final boss, so it wasn't that great as a race, but it was definitely a fun watch. Only real problem was the audio mix, the grating music pretty frequently drowned out the commentary.

Review: Strictly as a speedrun, this was pretty good. Blazing menuing, some truly busted glitches, skipping almost half the game with one trick, and fairly well explained. But if you also happen to be a Discworld fan, this has even more to offer. Silly cosplay? Pointing out all the witty jokes? Far too many character references? I'm not even the biggest Pratchett fan, and I was loving it. Maybe it'll fall a bit flat if you've never read any of the books the game is based on, but if you did? Definitely a must-watch.

And not being able to hear the runners coordinate really hurt - keeping SpikeVegeta on mute is *criminal*. It was a good showcase of KH skills, but not so much a good randomizer race.

Review: Top-level play in most rhythm games is insane. Even the Beatmania players were in awe of the display here. If there was any shortcoming, it was just that there wasn't too much variety - a lot of things looked pretty similar, an hour in. The boss songs at the end ramped it up, but a lot of the variation was too minor for a newcomer to see. But it was still one of the best showcases of the whole event.

Lots of OoB, heavy reliance on checkpoint warps, some very tight movement tech. I also wasn't expecting this level of hype out of a 2AM run, but the couch was popping off. There were a few bits that dragged - not every autoscroller has a skip yet - but it's a better run than many much more established games.

This game is not really marathon-safe even with a mod to multiply all card drops by 15x, but somehow we *almost* got both to finish - the DNF was at the final boss, after getting an impossible pattern, that puts you back at the start of a six-fight gauntlet, no saves allowed.

It's a very sadistic sort of difficulty - much more IWBTG than Kaizo. While the gimmicks kept changing, the fact that every single track was a gimmick track, made it wear out its welcome.

Review: This is pretty much pure execution. No real glitches, too much RNG for ultra-tight routing, just low-level gameplay polish and the ability to rapidly improvise. It's not the closest race, unfortunately, and two hours is perhaps a bit much for non-players to watch, but it's worth watching at least the back half, when some extra difficulty options are thrown into the mix.

Review: A run with some nice variety. A few bits are played as-intended, which on this difficulty is trivial, but much of it is glitched. While most of the glitches abuse the same core bug, they have a surprising spread of ways to do so, and so the run doesn't feel as monotonous as it could have.

Review: It's one of those runs where "beating levels" is not quite as important as "getting enough coins while beating levels", there's a lot of careful routing to maximize coin count. This does make most of the autoscrollers a bit more interesting, but it does sap tension once the last coin gate is passed.

Review: It's late-night filler, but for that, it's decent late-night filler. The speedrun is mostly moving to objectives quickly, which makes the frequent autoscroller-y chases annoying, and it's not quite broken enough to be fun, but Slyfincleton did a decent job explaining his run, and it wasn't nearly as dull as it could have been.

Review: Norishige had many good ideas for this run. His English is kind of stiff? Get a native speaker to run commentary. Cosplaying as Tuxedo Mask was fun, and he had lots of props and other little bits to try to make it exciting. Which makes it all the more disappointing that everything else didn't come together. Octopilion's commentary was lethargic, just completely devoid of interest. The gameplay is a pretty limited beat-em-up, and this category makes it worse because the AI mostly misses attacks against the smaller character. The couch talked extensively about the blindfolded run, which might have been more interesting, but that just made the slog we actually saw even less enjoyable.

Review: This run failed to work on several levels. The gameplay seemed very mashy, neither demanding nor rewarding skill. The glitches were woefully inconsistent. The jokes about TMNT mostly just fell flat, which I don't think was entirely due to my unfamiliarity with the franchise. But if any one thing killed this, it was the audio mix. The four runners talking over each other were constantly drowned out by the game audio of four characters talking over each other. There were lengthy sections were I just had to give up on making out words, and just watch the screen, because it was completely incomprehensible.

Review: A neat game, but the speedrun was highly forgettable. This category makes most combat trivial, so it's all down to platforming (and a few bosses), but it's also not a particularly precise or demanding platformer, so I'm not sure what was supposed to make this run fun to watch. The audio issues from the previous run persisted into this one, though at least with fewer people and a less shouty game, it was usually able to be understood.

Review: A hard hack even by kaizo standards. Very little in the way of speed tech, but "don't die" is enough of a challenge that I don't think it matters much. And the audio mix continued to be a problem - sure, the music was good, but I would rather have heard the runner or commentary better.

Review: To beat a game like this in under an hour, you need a lot of glitches and a lot of RNG manipulation, which is exactly what you get. Not the most riveting run, unless you're into coding-type stuff, but I think it would be a decent intro into that sort of thing.

Review: An extremely difficult run, as shown by the fact that one runner failed out and two failed to meet the Grandmaster requirements. But that unfortunately makes for a weak showcase, as it instead just looks like the runners are bad. And why was there a bonus incentive for something none of the runners have done before? This should have been a master class in Tetris, but it really did not connect well.

Review: I get the vibes that this run was a lot more fun if you actually have played Deltarune, because I think most of the chatter was jokes about the story that flew completely over my head. It wasn't unbearable as an outsider, but the target demo was clearly not "guy who has a half-finished Undertale save from six years ago". It's still a decent speedrun, and Shayy's enthusiasm was infectious, but the appeal was not meant to be universal.
