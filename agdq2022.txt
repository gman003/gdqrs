Review: A dubious choice to start the marathon with. This feels more like late-night filler than a triumphant show-starter, not bad but not as good as I was expecting. The run isn't super polished (as expected from a game this new), and could have benefitted from a good couch to explain things better. Axel's self-commentary was rather stilted, low-energy, and sometimes hard to understand. It's a jargon-heavy game and not all of it is obvious just from watching.

Review: Much like other Metroid Prime runs, but with some unique twists. It still has a lot of sequence breaking and out-of-bounds, but it adds some unique movement breaks like rocket-jumping.

Review: I was worried this was going to be a dull race, after the early splits just kept growing, ultimately spreading the runners across three levels, but it pulled around into a nail-biting finish. We had excellent commentary throughout, SilentWolf giving tech primers and SpikeVegeta giving a rainbow of color commentary.

Review: Not the most polished run, as expected of something so new. A bit hard to follow - they explain low-level tech but not the high-level objectives, so it's a freefloating sort of run, but better than you'd expect of such a new game.

Review: Another 2021 game being run, this one so broken that it bears almost no resemblance to the normal game flow. It's just movement, cutscene skips, and a few glitches to completely break the intended pathing. I don't think a single bit of combat happened. But that got it down to twelve minutes, and Seraphin kept a very good pace.

Review: It's a classic of the speedrunning scene, and coolkid is one of the best. You've probably seen Mega Man runs before, so it's the expected series of wall-clips, boss quick-kills, and i-frame abuse... but it's a good performance, with just a few minor mistakes that keep things interesting. Mithical9 put some serious effort in on commentary, a bit scripted but very informative, without being too dry.

Review: This is a hard game to figure out even playing as intended, so the speedrun only adds to the confusion. The commentary tries to keep up with the speed tech but this is probably not a great run if you want to understand things but have not played the game. If you have, or if you don't care, it's a nice fast-moving puzzle speedrun, with very little downtime.

Review: A new speed game, but one you might want to keep an eye on. The movement tech is very powerful, and gives you all your options from the start. It's already kind of nuts, and could get crazier as runners solidify their skills. About the only problem with this run is that it was too short to really explain everything that was going on.

Review: Long JRPG runs are divisive - their focus on deep knowledge rather than mechanical execution, and their length, makes them a different beast than most other speedruns. This was one of the better ones, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a long JRPG run. The commentary was good but inevitably jargon-heavy, the execution was pretty clean, and fortunately this game allow you to skip cutscenes. The focus on evading overworld encounters and highly-scripted boss fights reminds me more of Pokemon runs than other Final Fantasy runs I've seen, but it was enjoyable at that.

Review: A less busted run than the last, though whether that's down to coding or the release date remains to be seen. There's still lots of small clips and tricks, and I still question why NG+ is the norm for this series, when it makes combat downright trivial and doesn't seem to open up movement options. Be aware there's some major bitrate issues - I don't know if it's just the game, or lingering tech issues, but it was a pretty blocky image much of the time.

Review: Nominally a roguelite, but this beats it in one straight shot, so it's more like a regular shooter, just with more RNG and a heavy bullet-hell influence. As a very new game, it was basically glitchless, with only an anim-cancel for movement tech, but as a near-glitchless run, it's not bad.

Review: A quick bonus run. Two runs, nearly - due to a first attempt dying halfway through. That, heavy RNG, and a poor explanation of what the rules were or what was going on, makes this a skippable run for anyone that isn't a devotee of Returnal.

Review: A ridiculous run of a ridiculous hack. Sonic played as a golf game seems to work surprisingly well, and it's an even better speedrun. There's a nice mix of skipping over massive sections by driving over them, and some easy parts that became quite challenging under the new controls, and it's all accompanied by entertaining commentary.

Review: This was a bonus run? Everything felt stretched - I was literally yawning by the halfway point. Sure, it's amazing to see those long hovers and precise dribbles, but the pacing on this was far, far too slow. There was perhaps enough variety for a half hour - there was nothing that seven minutes of hovering through rings gave us, that the first minute did not, and for all their talk of specialization and unique levels, I think half of them were Superman 64 solve-my-maze tedium. Commentators spent as long shilling the game and the workshop as they did explaining tech, because there fundamentally isn't that much tech to this game.

Review: This is kind of an awkward speedrun. The first half is stuffed with cutscenes, and the first cycle is played almost entirely as intended. Then it's a trek over to the Deku Palace and a very glitchy wrong-warp straight to end of the final dungeon. It's very well-explained for something so technical - Gymnast and couch could probably teach a comp sci class better than my actual college professors did - but it's unfortunate that so much time is spent on the fixed-length intro.

Review: The game is much more like conventional Zelda games, at least in the top-down perspective, clear dungeons and bosses, and the very bouncy level design. And the cutscenes, though still not good, are at least less memetastically awful. But that makes it not quite awful enough to be a good Awful Block run, while still not being good enough to be outside Awful Block. It's mostly just tedious loading times, opaque quest design, and some killing bosses with chip damage because going a few screens over to grab the intended weapon would take longer.

There's very limited tech - the game is mostly autoscrollers - so it's not a good speed game, but if you're not riffing on it, where's the fun?

Review: Frame-perfect is a lot easier with a single-digit framerate. There's some novelty from being a Game.Com title, but that mostly just makes it not that great of a game. Commentary was informative but very unenthused - with Awful Block, I've come to expect excitement, either hyping up a game that does not deserve it, or unreservedly hating a game that does. This was more "yeah, it's a Game.Com game, the framerate is awful, we don't know how all these glitches happen, most of them aren't useful, I can't tell which level I'm on because they all look the same".

Review: This is basically a glitchless speedrun, and has little in the way of large-scale tech. As such, it could have been endless tedium. But Froob spent the run giving a running commentary not on the gameplay, but on the story, dragging us through every twist and turn of the murder mystery plot (and incidentally, spoiling Lost Judgement, the original game, and about half the Yakuza series).

And not being able to hear the runners coordinate really hurt - keeping SpikeVegeta on mute is *criminal*. It was a good showcase of KH skills, but not so much a good randomizer race.

Review: A fun-looking Portal 2 mod. There's no glitches that actually break the game, but plenty of puzzles solved in completely the wrong way. Not the most polished run, but pretty fun, especially for a self-commentated run.

Review: This was a shameless couch antics run. Like yes, there was some talk about tech and tricks, but it was mostly banter and gags. It was a riot at first, but some of the schtick wore thin by the end of it, and I think even the runner was getting annoyed by the end.

Review: A much, much drier run than the last Pokemon game we saw. Upside is that we got much more technical commentary, but the downside is that this just isn't interesting enough to hold interest for three hours off gameplay alone. Truely's run invalidated, used a backup save because of bad starter RNG.

Review: Past rhythm game exhibitions have sometimes featured one or two gimmick songs - like the Megalovania track in the Clone Hero showcase. This game appears to be nothing *but* ridiculous gimmicks - making it hard to see what the track even is, rather than being hard to perform. It's a very sadistic sort of difficulty - much more IWBTG than Kaizo. While the gimmicks kept changing, the fact that every single track was a gimmick track, made it wear out its welcome.

Review: To beat a game like this in under an hour, you need a lot of glitches and a lot of RNG manipulation, which is exactly what you get. Not the most riveting run, unless you're into coding-type stuff, but I think it would be a decent intro into that sort of thing.

Review: An extremely difficult run, as shown by the fact that one runner failed out and two failed to meet the Grandmaster requirements. But that unfortunately makes for a weak showcase, as it instead just looks like the runners are bad. And why was there a bonus incentive for something none of the runners have done before? This should have been a master class in Tetris, but it really did not connect well.

Review: I get the vibes that this run was a lot more fun if you actually have played Deltarune, because I think most of the chatter was jokes about the story that flew completely over my head. It wasn't unbearable as an outsider, but the target demo was clearly not "guy who has a half-finished Undertale save from six years ago". It's still a decent speedrun, and Shayy's enthusiasm was infectious, but the appeal was not meant to be universal.
