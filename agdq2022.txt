Review: A dubious choice to start the marathon with. This feels more like late-night filler than a triumphant show-starter, not bad but not as good as I was expecting. The run isn't super polished (as expected from a game this new), and could have benefitted from a good couch to explain things better. Axel's self-commentary was rather stilted, low-energy, and sometimes hard to understand. It's a jargon-heavy game and not all of it is obvious just from watching.

Review: Much like other Metroid Prime runs, but with some unique twists. It still has a lot of sequence breaking and out-of-bounds, but it adds some unique movement breaks like rocket-jumping.

Review: I was worried this was going to be a dull race, after the early splits just kept growing, ultimately spreading the runners across three levels, but it pulled around into a nail-biting finish. We had excellent commentary throughout, SilentWolf giving tech primers and SpikeVegeta giving a rainbow of color commentary.

Review: A very busted run, even for such a new game. Lots of out-of-bounds, in numerous ways, and no lack of other skips. I'm not sure Hard mode added all that much to the difficulty - it only ups the combat, which was mostly skipped - but a great run nonetheless.

Review: A new speed game, but one you might want to keep an eye on. The movement tech is very powerful, and gives you all your options from the start. It's already kind of nuts, and could get crazier as runners solidify their skills. About the only problem with this run is that it was too short to really explain everything that was going on.

Review: Long JRPG runs are divisive - their focus on deep knowledge rather than mechanical execution, and their length, makes them a different beast than most other speedruns. This was one of the better ones, but that doesn't mean it isn't still a long JRPG run. The commentary was good but inevitably jargon-heavy, the execution was pretty clean, and fortunately this game allow you to skip cutscenes. The focus on evading overworld encounters and highly-scripted boss fights reminds me more of Pokemon runs than other Final Fantasy runs I've seen, but it was enjoyable at that.

Review: A less busted run than the last, though whether that's down to coding or the release date remains to be seen. There's still lots of small clips and tricks, and I still question why NG+ is the norm for this series, when it makes combat downright trivial and doesn't seem to open up movement options. Be aware there's some major bitrate issues - I don't know if it's just the game, or lingering tech issues, but it was a pretty blocky image much of the time.

Review: Nominally a roguelite, but this beats it in one straight shot, so it's more like a regular shooter, just with more RNG and a heavy bullet-hell influence. As a very new game, it was basically glitchless, with only an anim-cancel for movement tech, but as a near-glitchless run, it's not bad.

Review: There's not too much in the way of tech - this is a very play-game-good run, but Ecdycis makes it a fun experience. The bonus boss fight afterward is a good way to cap it off.
